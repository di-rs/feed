OpenAI launches Prism, a free AI-native workspace for scientific writing powered by GPT-5.2, building on the acquired Crixet platform. The cloud-based tool integrates drafting, collaboration, and LaTeX compilation with AI that understands full document context, supports unlimited collaborators, and includes features like whiteboard-to-LaTeX conversion and voice editing for researchers.
