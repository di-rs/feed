TRUSTBANK's Furusato Choice platform uses OpenAI's multiagent architecture to help users navigate 760,000 hometown tax donation gifts through natural conversation. The Choice AI system employs specialized agents (Search, Recommendation, Greeting) with GPT-4.1, adding controlled randomness to promote regional diversity and achieving higher conversion rates than traditional search.
