OpenAI announces the retirement of GPT-4o and three other older models from ChatGPT on February 13, 2026, with API access unaffected. The decision follows user feedback that shaped GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.2 improvements in personality and creativity, with only 0.1% of users still selecting GPT-4o daily as the vast majority migrated to GPT-5.2.
