OpenAI launches the Codex desktop app for macOS, enabling developers to manage multiple AI agents in parallel with worktrees, skills, and automations. The app includes unlimited collaborators, built-in sandboxing, a skill library for tools like Figma and Linear, and scheduled background automations—while temporarily offering Codex access to Free and Go users with doubled rate limits for paid plans.
