OpenAI details the Codex App Server architecture, a JSON-RPC protocol that exposes the Codex harness to clients across CLI, IDE, and web platforms. The App Server evolved from internal tooling into a stable platform for partner integrations, managing thread lifecycle, config/auth, and tool execution while providing conversation primitives (items, turns, threads) for building rich UI experiences.
