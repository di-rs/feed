GPT-5 partnered with Ginkgo Bioworks to optimize cell-free protein synthesis through autonomous lab experimentation, achieving a 40% reduction in protein production costs. Over six rounds of closed-loop testing across 36,000+ reactions, the AI-driven system discovered novel reagent combinations that outperform traditional methods in high-throughput lab conditions.
