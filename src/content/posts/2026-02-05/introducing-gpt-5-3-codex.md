GPT-5.3-Codex debuts as OpenAI's most capable agentic coding model, combining GPT-5.2-Codex's frontier coding with GPT-5.2's reasoning while running 25% faster. The model achieves state-of-the-art on SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench, can build complex games autonomously over days, and was instrumental in optimizing its own development and deployment process.
