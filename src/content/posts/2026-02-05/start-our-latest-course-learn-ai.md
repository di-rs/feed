web.dev has launched "Learn AI," a new course written for web developers by Dr. Janna Lipenkova, aimed at practical AI system design rather than mathematical theory. The course covers how to choose models, structure AI systems, and deploy responsibly — offering frameworks for technical leadership around AI features. It's recommended to take in order, starting with AI system blueprints as a foundation.
