IntentRefiner is an AI agent built with Algolia Agent Studio that automatically converts vague user complaints into clear, actionable intents for support workflows. It uses historical issue data to detect patterns and outputs structured JSON for routing and resolution, improving support team efficiency without requiring conversational back-and-forth.
