Doug Parker from Angular's team shared Google's new Micro Frontend approach using complete isolation (no shared dependencies) and Protocol Buffers for messaging between autonomous apps. The episode also covers TypeScript 6.0 transitioning to maintenance mode before the v7.0 Go rewrite (targeting 10x performance), and Angular DevTools updates to the Signal Graph visualization for better resource grouping.
