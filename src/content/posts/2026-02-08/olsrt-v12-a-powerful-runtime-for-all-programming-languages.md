OLSRT v1.2 is a lightweight (~90 KB) runtime written in C that provides actors, async I/O, and green threads to any programming language via FFI. The upcoming v1.3 will introduce HCR (Hot-Coding References), a new concurrency paradigm that creates lightweight branches for processing data without blocking the main program.
