This tutorial extends Rust MCP servers with API key authentication using the official rmcp SDK, demonstrating how to build, test, and deploy a system information tool that validates keys against Google Cloud. The guide covers the complete workflow from local Rust development and Gemini CLI integration via stdio transport to production deployment as protected Cloud Run endpoints.
