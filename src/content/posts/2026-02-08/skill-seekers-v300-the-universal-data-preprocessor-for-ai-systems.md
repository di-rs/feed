Skill Seekers v3.0.0 is a Python tool that converts documentation into 16 different formats for AI systems, including LangChain, LlamaIndex, and various vector databases. With 26 MCP tools, cloud storage support, and CI/CD integration, it eliminates the need to write custom scrapers for RAG pipelines and AI coding assistants.
