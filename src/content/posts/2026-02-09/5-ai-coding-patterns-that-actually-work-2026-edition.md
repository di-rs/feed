Five practical AI coding patterns that genuinely improve developer workflow: describe requirements in plain language instead of coding, use AI as a rubber duck to challenge assumptions, write tests first then ask for implementation, iterate through refactoring chains rather than seeking perfect code upfront, and get instant code reviews by asking what would break in production. The key meta-lesson is that AI tools amplify existing developer knowledge rather than replacing it—the agent does the typing while you do the thinking.
