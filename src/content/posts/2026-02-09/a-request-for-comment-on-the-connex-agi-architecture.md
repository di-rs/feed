Connex AGI is a biologically-inspired multi-tier AGI architecture that aims to be a "compiler for human intent," transforming nebulous user goals into executable programs through specialized layers including perception/reflexes, planner/orchestrator, modular skill execution, self-improvement motivation, and a hive-mind registry for AGIs to share learned capabilities. The system implements dual-tier memory with short-term cache and long-term vector database, seeking community feedback on complexity, latency, and the practical viability of its Latent Metaphysical Core for action verification.
