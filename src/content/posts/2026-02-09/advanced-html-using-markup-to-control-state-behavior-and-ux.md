Modern HTML already controls state transitions, interaction flow, and user intent without JavaScript. Button types (submit, reset, button) have built-in behavior, <details> expresses state declaratively, forms manage focus and validation natively, and navigation provides scroll position, browser history, and shareable URLs. Advanced developers let HTML define structure and state, CSS define appearance, and JS upgrade interaction—ensuring apps work even when JavaScript fails.
