x402 Bazaar launches as the first autonomous AI-to-AI API marketplace using HTTP status code 402 (Payment Required), enabling AI agents to discover, pay for, and consume APIs independently using USDC micropayments on Base and SKALE chains. The platform eliminates traditional signup flows by implementing a protocol where agents respond to 402 responses with on-chain payment proofs, making true pay-per-use API access possible with sub-cent transaction fees.
