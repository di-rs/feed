OpenAI reportedly begins testing ads in ChatGPT for free users starting February 9th, while Anthropic's Super Bowl ad positioning itself as the ad-free alternative generated stronger positive sentiment than OpenAI's campaign. Meanwhile, India's Sarvam AI releases Bulbul V3 (text-to-speech) and Sarvam Vision (OCR) models optimized for Indian languages and document formats, demonstrating how sovereign AI can win adoption through local-first utility rather than competing on general capabilities.
