Part 3 of a series covering audio and video embedding creation using Amazon Nova 2 Multimodal Embeddings and AWS Java SDK. The guide demonstrates asynchronous Bedrock API usage for segmented embeddings, splitting media into 15-second chunks, and storing the results in Amazon S3 Vectors with support for various dimension sizes (3072, 1024, 384, 256) to balance accuracy and storage costs.
