A comprehensive guide to implementing API Gateway caching with Terraform to reduce Lambda invocations by up to 90%, demonstrating how enabling caching on a 10M request/month API can save $152/month while improving response times. The article includes production-ready Terraform modules, cache sizing recommendations, monitoring setup with CloudWatch, and real-world cost calculations showing typical savings of 70-90% on Lambda costs for cacheable endpoints.
