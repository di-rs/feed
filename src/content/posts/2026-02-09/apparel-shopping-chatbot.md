An apparel shopping site submission for the Algolia Agent Studio Challenge featuring a conversational chatbot for product discovery. Built with Algolia's InstantSearch.js widget and 2000-item apparel dataset, the chat interface leverages searchable attributes (title, description, product type, color, categories, price, tags) to assist customers in finding products through natural conversation.
