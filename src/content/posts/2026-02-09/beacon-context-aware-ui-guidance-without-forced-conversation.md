Beacon is a browser extension that proactively highlights relevant UI elements on webpages with contextual tooltips, eliminating the need to scroll, search, or chat with a bot. It indexes page structure (text, buttons, links, bounding boxes) into Algolia for millisecond-fast retrieval, then uses an AI agent to reason over results and decide what to highlight based on viewport and user context. An optional chat mode refines intent but the primary experience is ambient, non-conversational guidance that reacts to scrolling and page changes.
