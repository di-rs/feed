Step-by-step guide to balancing Binary Search Trees using inorder traversal to create a sorted array, then recursively building a balanced tree by selecting middle elements. Explains how unbalanced trees lose performance and includes complete implementations in C++, Python, and JavaScript with divide-and-conquer approach ensuring O(log n) height for optimal operations.
