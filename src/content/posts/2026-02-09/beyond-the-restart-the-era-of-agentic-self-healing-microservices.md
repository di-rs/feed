Moving beyond reactive container restarts that only address symptoms, agentic self-healing microservices use AI agents following the MAPE-K loop (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute, Knowledge) to automatically detect anomalies, perform root cause analysis, generate and test code-level patches, and deploy fixes through GitOps workflows with policy guardrails. Organizations implementing these patterns report up to 70% reduction in incident frequency and MTTR drops from 18 minutes to under 2 minutes, shifting from "healing the instance" to "healing the intent" by addressing logic bugs and schema mismatches autonomously.
