Part 5 of the Deno game tutorial adds player profiles, customization, and live tuning to the dinosaur runner game. Players can now set their name, choose dino colors, select background themes (desert, forest, night, rainbow, space), and adjust difficulty. Customization settings are persisted in PostgreSQL with players, player_settings, and high_scores tables, creating a personalized experience reflected in the global leaderboard.
