A comprehensive tutorial on building a production-ready hand gesture control system using TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe Hands. The system achieves 60 FPS performance with support for multi-modal gestures like pinch-to-drag, peace sign scrolling, and two-hand resizing, all running client-side without external servers.
