A production-ready platform for molecular property prediction that supports classical GNNs, quantum models (variational circuits, quantum kernels), and hybrid architectures under a unified pipeline. Built with JAX, it includes shared data ingestion from SMILES strings to molecular graphs with 3D geometry, BatchedGraph abstraction for efficient training, staged hybrid training, and FastAPI inference service—demonstrating how to responsibly evaluate quantum ML beyond toy examples.
