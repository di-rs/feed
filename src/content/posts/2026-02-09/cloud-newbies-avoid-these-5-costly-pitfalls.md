Five critical cloud cost pitfalls that newcomers face: poor instance selection from over-provisioning or mismatching workload types, wasted storage from using high-performance SSDs everywhere and never cleaning up snapshots, runaway networking costs from inefficient data transfers and egress charges, excessive security permissions that can lead to crypto-jacking and unauthorized bills, and unmanaged orphaned resources like idle instances and unattached load balancers. Strategic resource selection, data tiering, internal networking, security hardening, and regular resource audits can dramatically reduce cloud spending and prevent catastrophic bill shocks.
