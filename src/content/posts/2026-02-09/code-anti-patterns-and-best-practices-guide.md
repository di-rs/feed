A concise, conceptual guide to 12 common code anti-patterns and their better alternatives, presented in pseudo-code to emphasize design principles over implementation details. Covers switch/if-else ladders (use lookup maps), magic numbers (use named constants), code duplication (extract shared logic), redundant state (derive instead of store), and God components (split responsibilities). The guide prioritizes clarity over cleverness and advises measuring before optimizing.
