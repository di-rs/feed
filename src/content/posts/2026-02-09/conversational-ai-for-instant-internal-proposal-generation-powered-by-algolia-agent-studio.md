An AI system that transforms proposal writing from a time-consuming manual task to an instant, automated process using Algolia Agent Studio. Users paste a job description, and the agent analyzes intent, retrieves the best-fit profile from an indexed database of freelancer expertise, and generates a personalized, first-person proposal in seconds. Fast retrieval (milliseconds) makes the experience feel conversational rather than slow and interruptive.
