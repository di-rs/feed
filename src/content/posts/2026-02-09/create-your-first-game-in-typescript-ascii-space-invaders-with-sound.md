A comprehensive step-by-step tutorial for building a fully-functional Space Invaders clone from scratch using TypeScript with retro ASCII graphics, covering fundamental game development concepts including game loop architecture, collision detection, enemy AI, input handling for both keyboard and gamepad, and procedural sound effects using the tiny ZzFX library. The tutorial teaches type-safe game development without requiring any game engine, resulting in a playable game with score tracking, lives, level progression, and immersive audio.
