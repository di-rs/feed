The crypto industry needs clarity over hype, according to Vincent Liu (CIO at Kronos Research) in the first episode of "Crypto Minds, Unfiltered." He discusses BTC price misconceptions, common institutional errors, meaningful metrics for large-scale capital management, and emerging infrastructure like AI-driven trading and stablecoins, emphasizing practical knowledge and risk-aware decision-making over conference soundbites. The conversation provides a reality check on how capital is moved safely in crypto beyond narratives.
