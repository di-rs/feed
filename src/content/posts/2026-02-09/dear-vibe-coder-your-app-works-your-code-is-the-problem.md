While AI tools are essential for modern developers, "vibe coding"—where developers generate code without understanding it and fix issues by regeneration rather than comprehension—creates unmaintainable software that fails when scaled, modified, or debugged by others. The article argues that AI should augment engineering skills rather than replace the mental models, architectural thinking, and fundamental understanding required for sustainable software development, warning that this approach particularly harms junior developers who skip fundamentals and struggle in the job market where companies need engineers who can debug production issues and explain system behavior.
