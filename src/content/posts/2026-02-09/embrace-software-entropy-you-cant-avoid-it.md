Software entropy—the level of chaos in any system—is inevitable and increases with every feature, bug fix, or change, regardless of code quality. Even perfect implementations add essential complexity from evolving domain requirements. The article draws from the Tao of Programming to argue against analysis paralysis: instead of seeking perfect decisions or perfect code, developers should make good-enough choices, ship, and flow with entropy. Refactoring can mitigate but never eliminate the long-term upward trend of complexity.
