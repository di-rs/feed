A detailed walkthrough of extending Robert Nystrom's jlox interpreter with support for lists and for-in loops. The implementation covers parsing square brackets, handling subscript expressions, implementing list operations (push, pop, len), and desugaring for-in syntax into while loops. The author reflects on how breaking down complex problems into simpler primitives makes them solvable—a lesson from both compiler design and life.
