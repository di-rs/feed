A2UI is Google's new UI protocol that allows AI agents to generate declarative user interfaces on demand instead of relying on endless chat bubbles. It enables agents to create interactive mini-apps with structured components and actions, similar to Telegram mini-apps, providing richer back-and-forth interactions for complex tasks. The protocol treats UI as structured JSON data rather than executable code, allowing for safer, more controlled agent-to-user interfaces.
