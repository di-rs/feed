A submission for the Algolia Agent Studio Challenge that reimagines a developer portfolio by treating decisions as indexed data rather than narrative prose. The project uses atomic records optimized for retrieval, hierarchical tags, and deterministic sorting to create a searchable journal of projects, struggles, and decisions that scales with complexity and survives constant experimentation.
