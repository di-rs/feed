A practical guide to prompt engineering covering 8 effective techniques: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, emotion prompting, role-based, rephrase-and-respond (RaR), and chain-of-dictionary (CoD). The article also warns against common mistakes like overly vague prompts, contradictory instructions, overloading single prompts, and blind trust in outputs. Combining techniques (role + context + few-shot) often yields the best results for complex tasks.
