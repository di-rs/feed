Heimdall is a conversational code security assistant that combines transparent deterministic risk analysis with GitHub Copilot CLI's agentic AI. Unlike traditional tools that only detect problems, it provides the complete workflow: detects security risks with evidence receipts, generates secure code fixes using Copilot, writes PR descriptions automatically, and answers questions through multi-turn conversation. The hybrid "deterministic + agentic" architecture builds trust with transparent evidence first, then enhances with AI-powered code generation and interactive Q&A.
