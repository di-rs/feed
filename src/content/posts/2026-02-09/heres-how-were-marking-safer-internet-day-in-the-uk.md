Google is marking Safer Internet Day in the UK by spotlighting tools like Family Link and Guided Learning in Gemini, helping families navigate the digital world safely. The Be Internet Legends programme, run with partner ParentZone, has already trained over 10 million UK pupils to stay safe online. A new Family Guide to Online Safety 2026 — co-developed with the Internet Watch Foundation and Childnet — covers how to responsibly use AI tools for education.
