A full-stack developer shares how AI assists—but doesn't control—their React/Next.js workflow in production environments.

The key principle: AI is treated as a tool for faster iteration while maintaining clean architecture and accountability, not a replacement for engineering judgment on business logic, security, or performance-critical code.
