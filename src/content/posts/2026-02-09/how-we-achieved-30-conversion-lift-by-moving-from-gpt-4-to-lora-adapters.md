A case study on scaling content optimization for 75+ clients by switching from GPT-4 few-shot prompting to fine-tuned LLaMA 3 LoRA adapters. Voice consistency improved from 62% to 88%, conversion rates jumped 30% (from 2.0% to 2.6% CTR), and token costs dropped dramatically by encoding brand voice in model weights instead of sending 13,000-26,000 token examples with every request. The key insight: when scaling personalized LLM systems, encoding domain knowledge in weights beats paying repeatedly for static few-shot data.
