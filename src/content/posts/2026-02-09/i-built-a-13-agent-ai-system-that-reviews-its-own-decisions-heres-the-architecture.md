Deep dive into a production multi-agent AI system with 13 specialized agents, adversarial verification protocols, dynamic team composition, and lifecycle hooks that enforce quality gates. Features tiered adversarial checking (L0-L3), routing engine for task classification, separation of concerns between coordinators and specialists, and real failure stories that shaped the architecture including the Double-DA rule for scores above 80.
