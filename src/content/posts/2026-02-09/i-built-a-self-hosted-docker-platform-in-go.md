Introducing usulnet, a self-hosted Docker management platform built as a single Go binary (~50 MB) that handles containers, images, security scanning, monitoring, backups, reverse proxy, and multi-node deployments from one web UI. Features include Trivy security scanning, RBAC, 2FA, and 11 notification channels.
