Dyadem is an anonymous feedback platform where questions adapt based on community responses. Built for the Gemini 3 Hackathon, it uses AI to generate personalized follow-up questions, extract themes from all submissions, and produce narrative insights that regenerate as new data arrives. The system demonstrates how AI can improve questionnaires beyond traditional focus groups by learning what to ask next based on existing responses.
