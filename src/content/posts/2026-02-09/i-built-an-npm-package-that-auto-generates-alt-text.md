alt-images-ai is an npm package that automatically generates accessible image descriptions using OpenAI or Google Gemini vision models. It supports processing individual images, batch operations, entire HTML pages (finding and fixing missing alt attributes), and multi-language output. Built with TypeScript and zero runtime dependencies, it's designed for accessibility audits, CMS integration, e-commerce product descriptions, and static site generator pipelines.
