A 17-year-old high school student in Ghana built a handwritten digit recognition neural network from scratch using only a phone and Google Colab—no frameworks, just Python and NumPy with hand-coded forward pass, backpropagation, and gradient descent. The three-layer network (784-64-10) achieved 96% accuracy on MNIST test data after 20 epochs, scoring 0.947 on Kaggle's Digit Recognizer competition. By implementing backpropagation manually rather than using TensorFlow or PyTorch, the student gained deep understanding of how weights adjust through error flow and matrix multiplication to minimize prediction loss.
