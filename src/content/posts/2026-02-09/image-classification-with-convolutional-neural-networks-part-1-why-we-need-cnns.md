Introduction to why Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are necessary for image classification. Explains how CNNs make image classification practical by reducing input nodes, tolerating pixel shifts, and leveraging correlations in images, compared to traditional neural networks that struggle with large image datasets.
