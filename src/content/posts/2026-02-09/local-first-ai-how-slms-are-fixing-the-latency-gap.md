An exploration of the shift toward Small Language Models (SLMs) under 10B parameters for specialized tasks, emphasizing a "task-first" architecture approach. The article argues that smaller, locally-run models offer instant response times, better privacy, and superior cost-efficiency compared to large cloud-based models for most production use cases.
