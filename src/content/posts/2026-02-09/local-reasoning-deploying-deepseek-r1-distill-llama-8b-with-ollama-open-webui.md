Deploy DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B locally using Ollama and Open WebUI via Docker Compose for private, zero-latency AI reasoning on consumer hardware. The 8B distillation achieves 89.1% on MATH-500 and 77.3% on MMLU while running entirely offline with no API costs or cloud dependencies. Docker orchestrates Ollama (inference engine) and Open WebUI (ChatGPT-like interface) over a private bridge network, with optional NVIDIA GPU acceleration for faster token generation.
