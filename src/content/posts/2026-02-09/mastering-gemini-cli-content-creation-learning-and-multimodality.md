The final part of the Gemini CLI series explores multimodal capabilities including image generation with NanoBanana extension, using Gemini as a personal tutor for studying PDFs and creating flashcards, and grounding knowledge with web search. The CLI becomes a complete development and learning environment that handles code, images, audio, and PDFs from the terminal. Extensions framework allows plugging in tools like NanoBanana for creative asset generation directly from the command line.
