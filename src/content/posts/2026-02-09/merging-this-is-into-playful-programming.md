"This is Learning" and "Playful Programming" are merging to create a stronger open-source education community. The merger brings together TiL's 1,480+ articles from 175+ authors with PFP's robust platform, Discord community of 2,700 members, and California non-profit structure—resulting in 750+ articles now available on playfulprogramming.com while maintaining both communities' shared commitment to transparent, accessible developer education.
