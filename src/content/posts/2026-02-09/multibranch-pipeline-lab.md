A hands-on lab for setting up Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline with GitHub webhooks, covering automatic branch discovery, per-branch builds, and PR workflows. The tutorial demonstrates why companies need multibranch pipelines: they enforce CI for every branch, enable PR-based workflows, and eliminate manual job management with pipeline-as-code that matches real GitHub workflows.
