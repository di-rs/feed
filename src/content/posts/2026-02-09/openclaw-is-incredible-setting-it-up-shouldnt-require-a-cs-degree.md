OpenClaw is a powerful open-source personal AI assistant with proactive messaging, persistent memory, and autonomous background tasks, but its technical setup process creates a significant barrier for non-developers. TapnClaw bridges this gap by providing fully managed OpenClaw deployments on dedicated private infrastructure that launch in just 5 minutes with three simple steps: sign in with Google, choose your AI model, and connect Telegram—bringing OpenClaw's transformative capabilities to everyone, not just power users.
