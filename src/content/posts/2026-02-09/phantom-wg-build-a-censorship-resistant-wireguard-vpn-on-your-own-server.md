Open-source tool for setting up WireGuard VPN with censorship resistance via WSS tunneling (Ghost mode), multi-hop routing, and no web interface. Designed for developers, privacy advocates, and users in restrictive networks, Phantom-WG masks WireGuard traffic over HTTPS port 443 using wstunnel, bypassing DPI systems while maintaining modular configuration for client management and exit chaining.
