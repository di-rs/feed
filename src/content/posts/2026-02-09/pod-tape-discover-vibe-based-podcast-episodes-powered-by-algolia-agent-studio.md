A vibe-first podcast discovery platform that lets users search by feeling instead of keywords—tap "dopamine hit 🧃" or "main character energy ⭐" to get curated episode recommendations. Built with Next.js and Algolia Agent Studio, it translates emotional vibes into search intent, retrieves relevant episodes in milliseconds, and uses strict prompt engineering to ensure diverse, high-quality results. The system ingests Apple iTunes podcast data into Algolia and leverages fast retrieval for instant, conversational recommendations.
