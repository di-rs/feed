NullUpload is a privacy-first image processing toolkit that runs entirely in the browser using Canvas API and WebAssembly, requiring zero server uploads, no tracking, and no user accounts. The open-source tool offers image compression, format conversion (JPG/PNG/WebP/AVIF), resizing, and EXIF metadata stripping with GPS location warnings, with all source code publicly available for verification on GitHub.
