A visual guide to Python's core data types (lists, tuples, sets, and strings) using Flet for rendering. The tutorial demonstrates key differences between mutable/immutable objects, tuple unpacking, automatic duplicate removal in sets, set algebra operations (union, intersection, difference), and type checking with mypy through interactive code examples.
