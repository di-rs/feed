A guide to using AI Builder's new grounded prompts feature to query Microsoft Dataverse tables directly with natural language. The article details building a semantic search agent that takes user queries, cleans knowledge base data (stripping HTML, handling duplicates), applies rule-based relevance scoring, and returns high-confidence results (≥0.80) in strict JSON format. This enables smart, data-aware automation for summarizing proposals, checking statuses, and surfacing KB articles within Power Platform workflows.
