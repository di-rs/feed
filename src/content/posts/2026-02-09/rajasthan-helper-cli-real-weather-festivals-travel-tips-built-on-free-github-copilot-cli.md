Rajasthan Helper CLI is a colorful terminal-first tool that provides real-time weather using wttr.in API, festival information with facts and emojis, and curated travel tips for 10+ cities in Rajasthan and India. Built entirely using the free tier of GitHub Copilot CLI in just ~20 prompts, this project demonstrates how AI-assisted development can rapidly turn ideas into functional tools with rich terminal UI and API integration.
