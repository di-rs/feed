Red Flare is an AI-powered divergence detection platform that helps retail investors spot valuation, debt, and sentiment anomalies in NIFTY 500 and Nasdaq 100 stocks through natural language search. Built with Algolia Agent Studio for multi-index RAG, Query Rules for intent parsing, Yahoo Finance for real-time enrichment, and Upstash Redis for caching, it achieves 12-18ms search latency and generates risk scores with streaming AI analysis. The platform detects price/sentiment/fundamental mismatches and caches results for 6 hours to optimize repeat access.
