This comparison explores four open-source conversational AI frameworks with different design philosophies: RoomKit (multi-channel rooms), Pipecat (linear pipelines), TEN Framework (visual graph builder), and LiveKit Agents (WebRTC sessions). Each excels in different use cases—RoomKit for multi-channel orchestration spanning SMS/Email/Voice/WhatsApp, Pipecat for the widest ecosystem of 40+ AI services, TEN for visual agent building with avatar integrations, and LiveKit Agents for production voice agents with observability and self-hosting capabilities.
