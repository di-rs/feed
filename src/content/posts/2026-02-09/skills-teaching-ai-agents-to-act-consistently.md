Agent Skills are reusable instruction sets that teach AI agents to perform specific tasks consistently across tools like Claude, Cursor, and Copilot. Skills consist of SKILL.md (on-demand instructions), optional scripts/references/assets, and can be paired with AGENTS.md (global context) for reliable invocation. The approach shifts from ad-hoc prompts to retrieval-led execution, improving consistency and reducing errors in AI agent behavior.
