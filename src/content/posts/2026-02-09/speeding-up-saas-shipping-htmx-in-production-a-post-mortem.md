A detailed post-mortem of building a Reddit lead qualification SaaS using HTMX and FastAPI instead of React, achieving 70% faster development time and 60% less code by merging backend and frontend data layers through hypermedia. Discusses implementation patterns (polling, SSE for monitoring), trade-offs (server complexity shift, round-trip latency), and practical wins like sub-500ms feedback loops and simplified deployment.
