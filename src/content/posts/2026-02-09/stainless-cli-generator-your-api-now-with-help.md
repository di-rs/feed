Stainless now generates command-line tools for APIs directly from OpenAPI specs, with proper argument parsing, pagination, shell completions, and manpages. Built in Go for performance and cross-platform distribution, the CLI tools are self-documenting with `--help` support and designed to work seamlessly with AI agents that can discover available commands and construct valid requests automatically.
