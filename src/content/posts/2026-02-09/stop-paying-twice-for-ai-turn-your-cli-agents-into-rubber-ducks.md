MCP Rubber Duck now supports CLI-based AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) as free subprocess ducks using existing subscriptions instead of per-token API costs. Includes custom CLI provider support, mixed API/CLI councils for diverse perspectives, and trade-offs analysis covering speed differences (1-3s API vs 5-30s CLI) and tool availability limitations.
