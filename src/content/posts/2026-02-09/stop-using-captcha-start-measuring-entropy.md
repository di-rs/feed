Modern AI models can now solve reCAPTCHAv2 with 100% accuracy, rendering traditional CAPTCHAs obsolete. This article introduces isHumanCadence, a privacy-focused library that analyzes keystroke timing patterns (not content) to detect bots by measuring biological constraints like dwell time, flight time, rollover rate, and entropy—though sophisticated AI will eventually learn to mimic these patterns too.
