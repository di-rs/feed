OpenAI is testing ads in ChatGPT for Free and Go tier users in the U.S., while Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers remain ad-free. Ads don't influence ChatGPT's answers and conversations stay private from advertisers. Users can control ads, dismiss them, or upgrade to paid tiers to remove ads entirely.
