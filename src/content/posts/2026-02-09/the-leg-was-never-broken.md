A response to the "software engineering is back" manifesto arguing that while AI coding agents make writing code faster, frameworks still serve as crucial coordination protocols for teams. The author argues that frameworks aren't "intellectual surrender" but shared mental models that enable collaboration, and that understanding fundamentals remains essential even with powerful AI tools. The essay uses the metaphor of "grandfather's hammer" to explore how tools change but mastery still requires deep understanding.
