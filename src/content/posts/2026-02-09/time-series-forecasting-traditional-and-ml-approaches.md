A comprehensive guide to building production-ready time series forecasting systems, covering traditional approaches (ARIMA, Prophet) and modern neural networks (LSTMs, Transformers). The article emphasizes system architecture over algorithms, including data pipeline design, model serving infrastructure, scaling strategies, and deployment patterns. Key insight: traditional models often provide 80% value with 20% complexity, making them ideal starting points before investing in sophisticated neural approaches.
