TimeSlipSearch is a conversational search engine that answers natural language queries about pop culture history in under 100ms, searching across 420,000+ indexed records including Billboard Hot 100 charts, movie releases, gas prices, and historical events. Built with Algolia's multi-index parallel search, Next.js, and natural language date parsing, the retro VHS-styled interface supports queries like "Summer of '69" or "the day the Berlin Wall fell" and includes era-aware context generation, localStorage-based memory for search history and favorites, and sub-100ms response times essential for maintaining conversational flow.
