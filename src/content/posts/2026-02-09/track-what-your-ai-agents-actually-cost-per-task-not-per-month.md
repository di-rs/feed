Introduction to codesession-cli, an open-source CLI tool that helps AI agents track their own token usage, file changes, and costs per task in real-time. Uses SQLite storage with WAL mode, supports 17+ AI models with built-in pricing, tracks file changes via git diff, and provides JSON output for scripting with structured errors and session scoping by git root.
