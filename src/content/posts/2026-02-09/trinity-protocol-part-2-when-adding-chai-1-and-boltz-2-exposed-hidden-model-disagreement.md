A deep dive into RExSyn's multi-model protein prediction validation system, where adding Chai-1 and Boltz-2 validators to AlphaFold 3 predictions unexpectedly increased model disagreement rather than consensus. The experiment revealed that model disagreement is a valuable signal for detecting out-of-distribution targets, potentially saving months of wet-lab work by flagging high-risk predictions before synthesis.
