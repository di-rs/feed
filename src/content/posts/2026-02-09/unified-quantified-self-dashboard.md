A comprehensive tutorial for building a unified health data dashboard that aggregates metrics from multiple sources (Oura Ring, Apple Watch, CGM) to visualize correlations between sleep, activity, and glucose levels. The guide covers the complete data pipeline using SQLAlchemy for database integration, Pandas for time-series alignment and resampling of heterogeneous sampling rates, and ECharts for interactive visualizations with zoom capabilities, enabling users to discover patterns like how sleep quality affects blood sugar levels through data-driven insights rather than guesswork.
