Developer uses AI to build a Haxe-to-WASM transpiler called "wasmix", finding AI excelled at generating boilerplate and data structures (1000x speedup) but struggled with creative problem-solving and debugging (0.1x in some cases). The project demonstrated that AI can make niche languages and ambitious projects viable, but still requires strong human oversight for architectural decisions and ownership.
