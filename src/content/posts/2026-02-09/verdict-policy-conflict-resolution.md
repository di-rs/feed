Verdict is a decision engine for the Algolia Agent Studio Challenge that resolves conflicting customer support policies by retrieving relevant clauses, detecting contradictions, and applying a resolution hierarchy to produce structured verdicts with full citations. Unlike chatbots, it provides instant click-to-ruling decisions with transparent policy comparisons, leveraging Algolia's custom ranking and Rules for precise retrieval before LLM reasoning.
