Vibe Travel Planner is an Algolia Agent Studio Challenge submission that demonstrates contextual AI assistance without requiring typed conversations. Features include vibe-coded map markers (color-coded by destination mood), contextual popups with indexed data, smart trip wizard, score-based visual indicators, and multi-city itinerary building—all powered by Algolia's sub-100ms retrieval making the experience feel native rather than AI-powered.
