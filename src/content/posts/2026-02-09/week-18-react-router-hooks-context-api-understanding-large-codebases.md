A week focused on "thinking like a React developer" by mastering React Router hooks (useParams, useSearchParams, useNavigate), implementing nested and index routes in the WorldWise project, and deeply understanding Context API patterns through careful codebase analysis of the Atomic Blog project. Key realization: reading and understanding code architecture is just as important as writing code, especially when learning how real React applications are structured and how state flows through an app.
