A developer relaunches their blog as IgorIOT, shifting focus from general development to Java and Raspberry Pi hands-on projects, while moving Apache Kafka content to a separate dedicated space. The new blog will also explore Java in Education initiatives, aiming to make Java more accessible to students and educators through modern tools and practical approaches.
