Optimize Claude Code agent configurations by removing generic programming knowledge the model already knows and focusing on project-specific gotchas, team conventions, and configuration quirks. Key principles: use checklists over essays, convert deterministic workflows to skills not agents, consolidate overlapping agents, add quality gates to workflows, and document only what the model can't infer from code. Every token saved on generic instructions is a token available for actual code analysis.
