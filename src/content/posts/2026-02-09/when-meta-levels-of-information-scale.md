As information systems scale, representation increasingly comes before direct experience, and we encounter reality primarily through descriptions, summaries, and algorithmic curation rather than firsthand encounters. This creates growing epistemic distance where meaning becomes scarce amid abundant information, and the meta-layer of information begins to self-reinforce rather than reflect reality, raising questions about how to prevent representations from fully eclipsing the world they claim to describe.
