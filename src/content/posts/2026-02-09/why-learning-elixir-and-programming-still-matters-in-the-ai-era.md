Despite AI's ability to generate code and autocomplete logic, learning programming languages like Elixir still matters because AI can't replace the intuition and mental models required to reason about state, concurrency, and failure. Coming from JavaScript, Elixir's concepts like immutability, pattern matching, and functional programming force you to build better thinking patterns that remain valuable regardless of AI advancement. AI can shorten the distance between seeing an answer and understanding it, but it can't skip that gap where real learning happens.
