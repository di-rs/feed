A game design review analyzing "Rat with a Gun," a physics-based platformer built in one week. The review highlights how simple mechanics like recoil-based movement and a clever reloading system create organic difficulty sliders, while emphasizing that "game feel" and juice (satisfying feedback loops) are just as important as complex systems in successful prototypes.
