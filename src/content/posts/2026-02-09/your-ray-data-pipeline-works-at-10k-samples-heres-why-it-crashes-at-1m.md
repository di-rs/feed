A field guide to scaling Ray Data pipelines from 10K to 1M+ samples, covering five critical distributed systems problems: AllToAll barriers defeating streaming, memory estimation errors, task granularity, CPU oversubscription, and per-node GPU limits. Real-world lessons from scaling a vision-language model evaluation pipeline processing millions of video frames.
