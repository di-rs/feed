Compares generics implementation between Go (introduced in v1.18 with type parameters and constraints/interfaces) and Zig (using compile-time metaprogramming with the comptime keyword). While Go uses runtime type checking, Zig's approach generates type-specific code at compile time without runtime overhead, revealing the power of Zig's metaprogramming capabilities.
