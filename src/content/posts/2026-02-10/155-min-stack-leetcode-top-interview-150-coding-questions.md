A concise Java solution for LeetCode problem 155 (Min Stack) from the Top Interview 150 series, using a two-stack approach. One stack stores all values while a secondary min-stack tracks the running minimum, enabling O(1) retrieval of the smallest element at any time. This classic data structures problem tests understanding of stack operations and space-time tradeoffs.
