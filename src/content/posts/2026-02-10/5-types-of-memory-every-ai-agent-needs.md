This post breaks down the 5 types of memory AI agents need — short-term (context window), long-term semantic, episodic, procedural, and one that LLMs fundamentally cannot implement with current techniques. The taxonomy matters because building the wrong memory type for a use case wastes effort and creates poor user experiences. Particularly relevant for multi-agent system designers who need agents that learn and remember across sessions.
