Google Photos has introduced a new Ask button powered by Gemini models that lets you have conversations about individual photos, discover related moments, and request edits in natural language. Available to eligible users on Android and iOS in the U.S., Ask Photos can identify locations in your travel photos, search your library with conversational queries, and generate summaries of your memories. The feature combines the power of Gemini's multimodal understanding with your personal photo library to make exploring and editing photos more intuitive.
