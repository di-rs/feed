Defense in Depth (DiD) is a multi-layered security strategy that deploys complementary, interlocking controls across networks, systems, applications, and data layers. Unlike traditional perimeter-only defenses, DiD pairs every preventive control with a corresponding detective control at the same or downstream architectural level. This comprehensive approach provides resilient protection against sophisticated cyber threats by ensuring no single point of failure can compromise overall security.
