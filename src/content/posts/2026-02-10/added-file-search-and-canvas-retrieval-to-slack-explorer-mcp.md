The slack-explorer-mcp MCP server has been updated with two new tools: `search_files` for finding files (PDFs, canvases, images) within Slack with filtering by type/channel/user, and `get_canvas_content` for retrieving Slack canvas HTML content in a token-efficient format. This lets AI agents not just search Slack messages, but also access documents and structured knowledge stored in canvases — useful for historical context like design decisions.
