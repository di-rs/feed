A practical engineer's guide to squeezing reliable, predictable Wi-Fi performance out of MikroTik routers running RouterOS v7, covering channel width selection strategy, frequency planning, transmit power tuning, and country regulatory settings. The article also addresses common performance killers and the tradeoffs between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz optimization. Written for network engineers who need stable wireless in busy or production environments, not just "working Wi-Fi."
