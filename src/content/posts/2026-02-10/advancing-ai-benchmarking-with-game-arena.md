Google DeepMind has expanded Kaggle Game Arena with two new game benchmarks — Werewolf and poker (Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold'em) — alongside the existing chess benchmark. These new games test frontier AI models on social deduction, calculated risk, and decision-making under uncertainty, which better reflect real-world challenges than perfect-information games. The expansion aims to provide more robust and objective measures of AI capabilities in areas like planning, communication, and strategic reasoning.
