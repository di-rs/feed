A developer shares their journey using Claude Code's sub-agent workflow to build an autonomous browser assistant that combines a generative AI pipeline for reimagining websites with a multilayered memory system. The project draws on five months of professional browser automation experience to explore what a modern AI-native browser codebase looks like when built from scratch with agent teams. The article captures an emerging pattern in AI-assisted development that requires embracing uncertainty over precise control.
