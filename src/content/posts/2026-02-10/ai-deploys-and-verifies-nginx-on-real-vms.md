The author tests an AI-driven DevOps tool that goes beyond code generation — it spins up a real Ubuntu VM, generates a Bash script to deploy Nginx with basic authentication, executes it, and automatically validates the result. The tool provides a Grafana dashboard for real-time execution visibility, covering VM startup, script generation, execution, and final validation. This represents a shift from AI as a code assistant toward AI as a fully autonomous infrastructure operator.
