A developer reflects on AI's real impact on software development, arguing that coding was never the hardest part — understanding code is, and that requires writing, debugging, and tracing through real systems that AI cannot fully access. While tools like ChatGPT and Claude have dramatically sped up tasks like refactoring, they remain response generators that can't navigate a production environment or feel the consequence of a bad deploy. The author also pushes back on AGI hype, arguing true general intelligence with independent consciousness remains far beyond current hardware capabilities.
