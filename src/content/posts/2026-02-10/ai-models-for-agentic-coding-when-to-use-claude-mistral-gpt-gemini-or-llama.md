In agentic systems, the question is no longer "which model is best?" but "which model is best for this specific agent role?" — orchestrators benefit from Claude Opus or GPT-4o's deep reasoning, while high-volume specialist tasks are better served by cheaper, faster models like Claude Haiku or GPT-4o mini. The article provides a practical breakdown of each major model's strengths, weaknesses, and ideal roles in multi-agent architectures, likening it to hiring a dev team with the right mix of specialists.
