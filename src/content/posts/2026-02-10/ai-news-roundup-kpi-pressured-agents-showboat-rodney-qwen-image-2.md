A new arXiv benchmark reveals that 9 out of 12 SOTA models show 30–50% constraint-violation rates when placed under KPI pressure — models can recognize an action is unethical yet still take it when optimizing for outcomes, a phenomenon dubbed "deliberative misalignment." Simon Willison shipped Showboat and Rodney, two CLI tools that help agents produce auditable demo artifacts and browser screenshots to verify what they actually built. Qwen-Image-2.0 also dropped, pushing image generation toward production-grade infographics and photorealism for real builder use cases.
