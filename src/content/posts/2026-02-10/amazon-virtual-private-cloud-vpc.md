Amazon VPC provides a logically isolated section of AWS where you can launch resources in a virtual network with full control over IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways. Without a VPC, resources would be directly exposed to the internet with public IPs — a significant security risk. Core components include public/private subnets, Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, and route tables that together form a secure, customizable network environment for production deployments.
