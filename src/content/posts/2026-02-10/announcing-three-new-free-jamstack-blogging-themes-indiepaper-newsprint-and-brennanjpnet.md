Brennan Brown has released three new free and open-source JAMstack blogging themes — IndiePaper, Newsprint, and brennan.jp.net — aimed at the IndieWeb community and anyone wanting a clean personal blog without fighting complex configs. The release was inspired by a donation for his earlier 11ty theme RetroWeird, prompting a return to practical, usable theme development. All themes are open source and freely available for anyone to use.
