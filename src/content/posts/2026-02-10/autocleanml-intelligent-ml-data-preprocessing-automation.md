AutoCleanML is a Python library that automates the most repetitive parts of ML data preprocessing — handling missing values, encoding categoricals, scaling features, and producing train/test splits — in just a few lines of code. Built for students and beginners who find themselves rewriting the same boilerplate across every project, it follows best practices out of the box and returns a preprocessing report alongside the cleaned data. Available via `pip install autocleanml` with the source on GitHub.
