As marketing teams publish landing pages at software-development velocity, traditional manual QA can't keep up — leaving broken forms and dead funnels hemorrhaging ad spend for days before detection. The author argues that real-time behavioral monitoring, not just link and image checks, is now essential infrastructure for high-velocity publishing workflows. Detecting functional leaks (e.g., a form that renders but doesn't submit) requires automated systems that verify business logic, not just page structure.
