A Manifest V3 Chrome extension that automatically detects when you get an "Accepted" verdict on LeetCode and pushes your solution to a GitHub repository, organized by difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard) with rich metadata. Built with the GitHub REST API and vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks — it also includes a floating backup button for cases where auto-detection fails. The result is a zero-friction way to build a well-organized solutions archive without any manual copy-paste workflow.
