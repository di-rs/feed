A hands-on hardware comparison for running OpenClaw as a self-hosted always-on AI assistant, covering Raspberry Pi 5 (~€95), Intel N100 Mini PC, NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (ClawBox, €399), and Mac Mini M4 (~€650+). The author recommends the Mac Mini M4 for maximum local model performance and the Jetson for a balance of 67 TOPS AI compute, passive cooling, and low power draw when budget is a concern.
