A practical take on using a simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for predictive web infrastructure scaling — forecasting traffic spikes 10 minutes ahead instead of reactively scaling on CPU thresholds. The author's stack combines n8n for data pipeline orchestration, Python for model training with backpropagation, and React/PHP for acting on the model's predictions. The post frames neural networks in 2026 as just another practical library in a developer's toolkit, not black-box magic.
