A step-by-step tutorial for building a Python desktop app that monitors folders, categorizes files by size, and automatically organizes them into subfolders. The app uses Tkinter for the GUI, watchdog for real-time folder monitoring, and tkinterdnd2 for drag-and-drop support, with threading to keep the UI responsive. It features live file previews with filtering and sorting, plus a JSON-based config to persist monitored folder settings across sessions.
