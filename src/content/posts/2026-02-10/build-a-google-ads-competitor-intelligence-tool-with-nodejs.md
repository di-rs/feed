Since 2023, Google requires all advertisers to verify their identity and makes their ads publicly searchable via the Ad Transparency Center — this tutorial shows how to automate that goldmine with Node.js. The tool pulls every ad a competitor is running, tracks how long each creative has been live (survival equals profit), and uses OpenAI to analyze their messaging strategy. The stack is Node.js + SQLite for local tracking + a social vault API to query Google's Ad Library.
