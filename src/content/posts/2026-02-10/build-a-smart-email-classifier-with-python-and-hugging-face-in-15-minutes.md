This tutorial walks through building an AI-powered email classifier using Hugging Face's pre-trained `facebook/bart-large-mnli` model for zero-shot classification and the Gmail API to fetch real emails. The classifier automatically sorts incoming messages into business-relevant categories like urgent, spam, support, and sales, running as a lightweight background service. No ML expertise required — it costs less than $10/month for most small businesses and requires only Python 3.8+ and a Gmail account with API access.
