The make-mcp-server is an unofficial Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI assistants like Claude to Make.com's automation platform via natural language. It lets you search 200+ Make.com modules, get detailed configuration info, and create or deploy automation scenarios directly from your AI workflow. This brings Make.com's powerful no-code automation into the agentic AI stack through the standardized MCP interface.
