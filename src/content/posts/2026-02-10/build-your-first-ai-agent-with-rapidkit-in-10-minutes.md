RapidKit cuts the usual AI integration pain — no more wiring up five packages, writing retry logic, or debugging provider configs — down to about 50 lines of custom code and 10 minutes. The result is a production-ready AI Assistant Service with multiple provider support, streaming responses, conversation history, response caching, and health monitoring built in. The guide uses FastAPI and Node.js to demonstrate the full setup from workspace creation to a working chat completions endpoint.
