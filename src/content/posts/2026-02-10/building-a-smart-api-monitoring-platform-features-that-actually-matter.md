The author outlines an API monitoring platform built on three pillars—prevention, intelligence, and cost control—that validates requests before they reach external APIs rather than just alerting after failures. A validation layer checks API key auth, rate limit compliance, and malicious patterns to block invalid requests at the edge, saving bandwidth and preventing security incidents. The platform targets the gap between heavyweight observability tools and simple uptime monitors, with a focus on preventing wasted API calls and unexpected cost overruns.
