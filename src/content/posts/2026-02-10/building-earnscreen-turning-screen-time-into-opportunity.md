A developer built EarnScreen, an app that reframes screen time management by incentivizing kids to complete offline activities before accessing their devices — rather than simply blocking or restricting usage. Motivated by research linking excessive screen use to anxiety and depression in kids, the app gamifies healthy habits so stepping away from screens feels rewarding. It targets the gap between "fine" screen use and problematic overuse before bad patterns set in.
