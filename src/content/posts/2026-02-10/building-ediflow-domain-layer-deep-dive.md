Part 2 of the EDIFlow series explores the hard design decisions behind building a proper Domain Layer in TypeScript using Clean Architecture and DDD principles. The author walks through the critical question of what actually belongs in the domain — not parsing logic or technical details, but pure business concepts like message type, version, validation rules, and identity. The post covers trade-offs between Entities vs Value Objects and why getting the domain boundary wrong forces costly rewrites.
