A comprehensive guide to architecting a modern food donation platform that connects donors, NGOs, and volunteers, covering microservice design including an API gateway, authentication with role-based access control (RBAC), donation management, and a smart matching engine built on Redis queues. The article emphasizes real-time systems, geospatial indexing with PostgreSQL or MongoDB for location-based routing, and WebSocket-powered notifications — well beyond the typical CRUD tutorial. Recommended backend frameworks include NestJS, FastAPI, and Golang for high-performance APIs.
