After multiple failed attempts at building reliable AI chatbots, the author shares three key patterns that work in production: tool-augmented architecture (giving LLMs real tools instead of letting them freestyle), multi-agent routing (specialized sub-agents per intent), and graceful human handoff with sentiment detection and confidence thresholds. The post focuses on getting AI to talk *usefully* within business constraints rather than just getting it to talk at all.
