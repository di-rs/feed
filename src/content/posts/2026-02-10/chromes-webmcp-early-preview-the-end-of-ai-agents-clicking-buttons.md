WebMCP is a proposed browser standard (early preview in Chrome 146 Canary) that lets websites expose structured tools with JSON schemas directly to in-browser AI agents. Instead of agents scraping the DOM or guessing button placements, they can call well-defined functions like `book_flight()` with typed parameters and schemas. This shifts AI-web interaction from brittle UI automation to a formal contract between sites and agents, with the site controlling what actions are allowed.
