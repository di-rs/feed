Clariseque is a new AI-powered vulnerability assistant that filters the endless noise of CVEs by checking whether a given advisory actually applies to your specific tech stack (e.g., Next.js, PostgreSQL, Docker). You describe your stack once, then query CVE numbers or security questions in natural language and get stack-relevant impact analysis plus actionable remediation steps. It's currently free and in early launch, targeting full-stack developers who waste time manually triaging security advisories.
