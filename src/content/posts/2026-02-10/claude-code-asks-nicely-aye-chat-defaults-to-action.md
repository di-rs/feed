The author contrasts Claude Code's cautious approval-first workflow with Aye Chat, an AI coding tool built around an "optimistic" default-to-action model — it writes files directly but snapshots every change so reversals are instant. The core argument is that constant confirmation prompts ("Are you sure?") interrupt developer flow and slow productivity, while a reliable undo mechanism makes acting-first faster and less risky in practice. This trade-off between safety guardrails and developer velocity is increasingly central to AI coding tool design.
