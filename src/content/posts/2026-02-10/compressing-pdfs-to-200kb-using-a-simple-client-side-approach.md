A developer built a client-side PDF compression tool in React that runs entirely in the browser without uploading files to a server. The tool targets strict size limits like 200KB while keeping user data private, making it ideal for form submissions and document uploads on sites with tight file size restrictions. Browser-based PDF handling is increasingly practical for common use cases, especially on mobile.
