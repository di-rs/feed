A beginner-friendly overview of Java constructors — special methods automatically called when an object is created, used to initialize instance variables without a return type. The post covers three types: default (no-parameter), parameterized, and overloaded constructors, along with the `this` keyword for disambiguating between constructor parameters and instance variables. Key rules include constructors having the same name as the class, not being inheritable, and Java auto-providing a default constructor when none is defined.
