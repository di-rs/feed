Contract-first integration means writing the API specification (OpenAPI spec or Avro schema) before writing any code, making the contract the single source of truth for all teams. This approach eliminates ambiguity, lets frontend and backend teams work in parallel using mock servers, and enables automated CI checks that catch breaking changes before they reach production. The guide walks through a practical Spring Boot + OpenAPI + Kafka implementation with real YAML examples.
