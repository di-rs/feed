Dynamic forms driven by JSON schemas unlock flexible, maintainable UIs for admin panels, multi-step wizards, and role-specific interfaces. This guide covers using Laravel's backend to define form schemas and Vue 3's Composition API for reactive field rendering, combined with Laravel Precognition for real-time validation without duplicating rules on the frontend. The approach eliminates hardcoded inputs and enables rapid prototyping without frontend-backend coordination delays.
