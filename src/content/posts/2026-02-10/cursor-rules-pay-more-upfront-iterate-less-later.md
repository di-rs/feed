A hybrid rules approach for Cursor AI that splits configuration into a lightweight AGENTS.md (always loaded) and modular .cursor/rules/ files (loaded contextually), saving up to 70% on wasted context tokens. By paying more tokens upfront with well-defined rules, you get correct implementations in fewer iterations—your time and total token cost both decrease significantly.
