CVE-2025-40551 is a critical (CVSS 9.8) unauthenticated RCE vulnerability in SolarWinds Web Help Desk, combining an authentication bypass with insecure deserialization via the legacy `jabsorb` library to enable JNDI injection and SYSTEM-level code execution — no credentials required. The flaw is actively exploited in the wild and listed on CISA's KEV catalog, with an EPSS score of 0.55. Remediation requires upgrading to SolarWinds WHD version 2026.1 or later and blocking outbound LDAP/RMI traffic from the WHD server.
