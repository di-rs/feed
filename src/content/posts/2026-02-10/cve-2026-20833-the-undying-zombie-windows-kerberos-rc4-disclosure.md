CVE-2026-20833 (CVSS 5.5) exposes how Windows KDC continued accepting RC4-HMAC encryption — a cipher broken since 1987 — enabling local attackers to force authentication downgrades and execute Kerberoasting attacks for offline credential cracking. The vulnerability affects all Windows Server versions from 2008 through 2025, and Microsoft has patched it via KB5073381 with registry enforcement to permanently disable RC4. Mitigation requires disabling RC4-HMAC via Group Policy and setting the KdcForceAES registry key on Domain Controllers.
