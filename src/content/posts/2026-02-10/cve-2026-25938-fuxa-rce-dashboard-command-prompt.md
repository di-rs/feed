A critical CVSS 9.5 authentication bypass in FUXA (versions 1.2.8–1.2.10), a popular open-source SCADA/HMI dashboard, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to achieve RCE by exploiting unprotected Node-RED admin API endpoints. Attackers can POST malicious JavaScript flows to execute arbitrary system commands; the issue is fixed in version 1.2.11, and affected users should upgrade immediately or disable the Node-RED plugin.
