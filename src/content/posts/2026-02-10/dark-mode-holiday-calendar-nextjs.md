Frustrated with ad-heavy holiday calendar sites, the developer built HolidaysCalendar.net — a zero-ads, clean Next.js app using static site generation and Tailwind CSS dark mode. The site uses pre-rendered pages with local JSON datasets (no external API calls) for instant load times and a 100/100 Lighthouse score. It's a classic "scratch your own itch" project that prioritizes developer and user experience over monetization.
