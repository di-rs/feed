This guide walks through a minimal yet production-ready CI/CD pipeline for deploying Laravel 12 applications to a VPS (or EC2) using GitHub Actions and SSH, covering server setup with Ubuntu, Nginx, PHP-FPM, and MySQL. The focus is on a reliable, repeatable deployment workflow that avoids the complexity of over-engineered solutions while still enabling zero-downtime releases. It's aimed at developers who want to automate deployments without sacrificing control or maintainability.
