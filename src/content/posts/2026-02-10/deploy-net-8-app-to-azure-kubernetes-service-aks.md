This end-to-end guide covers containerizing a .NET 8 Weather Forecast API and deploying it to Azure Kubernetes Service using Docker, Azure Container Registry, and a CI/CD pipeline. It simulates a real-world DevOps workflow — from local testing to a scalable, production-ready Kubernetes deployment. All required tools are covered: Azure CLI, kubectl, and GitHub Actions for automated updates.
