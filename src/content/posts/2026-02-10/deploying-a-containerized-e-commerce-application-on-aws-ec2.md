This walkthrough covers deploying a containerized e-commerce app on AWS EC2 using Docker and Docker Compose, covering the full pipeline from version control to running production services. The author directly addresses the questions that arise when leaving localhost: how to package the app, push it to a container registry, start services reliably, and observe what's actually running. It's a practical end-to-end DevOps exercise focused on the real decisions that separate development from production deployments.
