A backend developer's practical guide to integrating AI into daily workflow using OpenAI Codex in 2026. The author uses codex-cli for frontend scaffolding, build configs, and boilerplate automation, while relying on IntelliJ with Codex for backend work (preferred over Windsurf for stability and clean diffs). The MCP feature enables better communication between CLI and IDE AI contexts. While emphasizing that AI output requires judgment and review, the author argues that developers who effectively use AI tools will significantly outpace those who don't.
