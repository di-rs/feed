A transparent benchmark comparison of 8 email verification APIs reveals that cheaper options ($5-20 per 10k emails) perform just as well as expensive ones ($50-75 per 10k) with accuracy ranging from 97.8% to 99.3%. All providers perform essentially the same core functions (checking MX records, SMTP handshakes, and flagging risky addresses), making the 15x price difference hard to justify. The benchmark scripts are open-sourced for independent verification, with Verifly and VitaMail offering the best value for budget-conscious users.
