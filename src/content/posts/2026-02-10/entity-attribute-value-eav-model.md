The Entity–Attribute–Value (EAV) model is a flexible database design pattern that allows defining attributes at runtime rather than using fixed columns, making it ideal for systems with sparse or highly variable data. It's commonly used in e-commerce platforms, CMS, and real-estate systems where different records require different attribute sets. The article uses a CMS as a practical example to explain when and how to apply EAV effectively.
