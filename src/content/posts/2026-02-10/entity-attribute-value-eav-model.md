The Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model is a database design pattern that allows attributes to be defined at runtime rather than as fixed schema columns — ideal for systems with sparse, variable, or user-defined fields. It's commonly used in e-commerce platforms, CMS, and product catalogs where different entities need different attributes. The article explains when EAV shines (sparse data, frequently changing attributes) and when to avoid it (stable schemas, complex analytics, high-performance queries).
