Google is dramatically deepening its AI footprint in Singapore, announcing a Google DeepMind research lab expansion, healthcare AI partnerships using MedGemma with AI Singapore (AISG), and a new Google Cloud Singapore Engineering Center. The company is also launching "Majulah AI," a comprehensive initiative targeting 350,000+ Singaporeans for AI skill-building, with physical Google AI Living Labs in educational institutions to empower 50,000 students by 2027. A new AI Center of Excellence for security will tackle emerging threats including agentic AI and mobile ecosystem vulnerabilities.
