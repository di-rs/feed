Part 1 of a comprehensive guide covering the identity and setup phase for deploying iOS apps to TestFlight. The tutorial walks through installing EAS CLI, initializing the project, configuring bundle identifiers, defining build profiles for store distribution, setting up OTA updates via channels, and preparing the project for building. This foundational step ensures proper coordination between local development, Expo Application Service, and Apple's ecosystem before moving to actual app building and testing.
