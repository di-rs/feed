"Fail fast" is about getting feedback early rather than polishing in isolation — the goal is clarity, not speed for its own sake. Java's HashMap exemplifies this pattern at the data structure level: it throws an exception immediately when modified during iteration, surfacing bugs early rather than letting them silently propagate. Applying this philosophy to backend development means running your app early and often, letting errors guide you rather than waiting for a "perfect" codebase first.
