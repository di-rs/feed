A technical guide to building an intelligent medical triage agent using HL7 FHIR standards and LangChain. The system parses clinical reports, maps them to standardized FHIR resources, identifies urgency from diagnostic results, and automatically schedules appointments with appropriate specialists via AWS Lambda. By teaching AI agents to speak FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources), the solution bridges the gap between messy patient data and actionable medical workflows while ensuring global healthcare system compatibility.
