Rich Harris (Svelte creator) joined PodRocket to discuss his Performance Now talk on "Fine Grained Everything," arguing that the next wave of frontend performance will come from better primitives rather than micro-optimizations. The conversation explores what comes after React Server Components and how fine-grained reactivity models could reshape UI framework architecture. Harris contends that the future of performance is about rethinking foundational building blocks, not squeezing milliseconds.
