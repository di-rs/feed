A developer tests Java on BeagleBoard single-board computers — BeagleY-AI (ARM) and BeagleV-Fire (RISC-V) — as part of a 2026 learning journey comparing architectures against Raspberry Pi. The article contrasts ARM's mature ecosystem with RISC-V's open-source, vendor-lock-free approach, and provides detailed specs across multiple BeagleBoard models. BeagleV-Fire's RISC-V + FPGA combination stands out as a uniquely flexible option for embedded and AI applications.
