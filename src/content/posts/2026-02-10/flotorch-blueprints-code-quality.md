FloTorch Blueprints provide an Infrastructure-as-Code approach to defining AI agents and workflows as reusable JSON templates for automated code review. The system orchestrates seven specialized agents (retrieval, code analysis, test coverage, security, performance, documentation, and synthesis) to provide comprehensive automated code reviews. Blueprints enable consistent behavior, version-controlled review logic, reproducible deployments across environments, and scalable multi-agent orchestration without manual integration work.
