A comprehensive, reproducible guide to setting up Flutter on Apple Silicon macOS, covering the full toolchain — Xcode, Android SDK, Java JDK, CocoaPods, and Flutter — in the correct install order to avoid dependency conflicts. Each tool's role in the build pipeline is clearly explained, from why Android Studio is optional to why JAVA_HOME must be correct for Gradle builds. Designed for targeting Android (physical device), iOS, and native macOS apps without needing an Android emulator.
