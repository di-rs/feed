Forgetful v0.2.0, an open-source AI memory MCP server, ships Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming and activity tracking so external services can subscribe to memory events (new memories, alias updates, artifact deletions) instead of polling. The release also includes a paginated and sortable graph endpoint for building visual knowledge graph interfaces. The project is built with Claude Code and community feedback from Discord, Reddit, and DEV.to.
