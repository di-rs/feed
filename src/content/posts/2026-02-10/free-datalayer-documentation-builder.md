Frustrated by chaotic 40-page Word tracking plans causing constant dev/analyst miscommunication, the author built a free schema designer for GA4 dataLayer events. The tool lets you define events, properties, and entities in one place and export structured specifications for GTM/GA4 implementation. The goal is to create community-driven templates for common event models so teams stop reinventing the wheel with blank Word docs.
