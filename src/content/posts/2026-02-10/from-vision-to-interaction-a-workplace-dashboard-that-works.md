A hands-on project breakdown of building a fully interactive, responsive company dashboard (TechFlow Innovations) from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript with a modular architecture. The dashboard includes a responsive CSS Grid layout, dynamic greeting widget with weather display, card-based events and announcements with priority tags, team spotlight, and real-time metrics — all built without a framework. The project serves as a practical exercise in front-end fundamentals, UI/UX patterns, and accessibility best practices.
