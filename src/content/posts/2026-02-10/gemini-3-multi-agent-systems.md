A comprehensive guide to building production-ready multi-agent AI systems using Gemini 3 and Vertex AI Agent Builder. The article explains the agentic loop architecture (perception, reasoning, action, observation) and demonstrates how to create specialized worker agents coordinated by a manager orchestrator to avoid token bloat. Gemini 3's native function calling, expanded context window, and multimodal reasoning capabilities enable more reliable autonomous systems compared to previous models, with practical implementation examples using Python and the Vertex AI SDK.
