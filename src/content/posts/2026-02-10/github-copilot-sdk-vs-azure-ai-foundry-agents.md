GitHub Copilot SDK and Azure AI Foundry Agents solve different problems: Copilot SDK is for developer-facing tools and Copilot Extensions while Foundry Agents targets general enterprise use cases like customer support, document processing, and ops automation. Most enterprises will use both — Copilot SDK for the developer layer, Foundry for the business layer. Both carry enterprise-grade security certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001) and the confusion mainly stems from overlapping marketing language around "agents."
