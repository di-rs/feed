An overview of how Graph RAG and Agentic RAG represent the next evolution beyond traditional vector-based retrieval-augmented generation. Graph RAG leverages knowledge graphs to capture relationships between entities for richer, more contextual retrieval, while Agentic RAG enables AI agents to dynamically decide when and how to retrieve information across multiple steps. Together these approaches address the limitations of flat vector search by supporting multi-hop reasoning and adaptive retrieval strategies.
