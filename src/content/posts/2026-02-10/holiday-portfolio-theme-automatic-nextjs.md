A developer shares their implementation of dynamic holiday themes for their portfolio website using Next.js, featuring automatic theme changes for Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Halloween, and Christmas with interactive effects like mouse click sparkles and custom cursors. The solution uses CSS variables and a ThemeScheduler component to automatically detect dates and apply themed color schemes without manual intervention.
