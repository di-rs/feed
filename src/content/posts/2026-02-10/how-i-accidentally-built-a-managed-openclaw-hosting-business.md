A Rails developer who became his friend group's unofficial OpenClaw support guy turned that experience into a managed hosting product called ClawHosters.com. The service provisions a fully configured OpenClaw instance on Hetzner Cloud in under a minute using pre-built server snapshots — no Docker headaches, no port forwarding nightmares. It supports Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, and Slack, with bring-your-own API keys for Anthropic or OpenAI.
