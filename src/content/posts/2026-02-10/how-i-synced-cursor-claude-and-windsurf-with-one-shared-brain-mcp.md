The author built Nucleus, an open-source MCP Recursive Aggregator that creates a persistent local-first memory layer (called Engrams) shared across AI coding tools like Cursor, Claude, and Windsurf. Instead of manually copying context between tools, Nucleus syncs all agents through a unified ledger so knowledge from one tool is instantly available in another. It includes a security Hypervisor layer that SHA-256 hashes every tool call for auditability, with a default-deny policy for filesystem access.
