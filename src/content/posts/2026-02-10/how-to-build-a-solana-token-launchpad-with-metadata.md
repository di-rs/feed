A beginner-friendly guide to building a Solana token launchpad using the Token22 program with Next.js and TypeScript. The tutorial covers creating mint accounts (requiring a keypair, public key, rent, space, and programId), adding token metadata like name and symbol, and handling transaction signing with partial signatures from both the mint keypair and the user's wallet via the Solana wallet adapter.
