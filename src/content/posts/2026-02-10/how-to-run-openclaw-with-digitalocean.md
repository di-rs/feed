A tutorial covering three DigitalOcean deployment options for OpenClaw (the self-hosted AI assistant): bare Droplet for full control, 1-Click Application for fast secure solo deploys, and App Platform for production-grade scalability with auto-scaling and zero-downtime deploys. The 1-Click and App Platform options come pre-configured with gateway token auth, hardened firewall rules, non-root execution, and Docker container isolation. Helps users choose the right tier based on whether they're experimenting or running OpenClaw in a production environment.
