A quick walkthrough for getting uptime monitoring running in under 5 minutes using OwlPulse — a free-tier service (5 monitors, 5-min intervals, no credit card) built as an affordable alternative after UptimeRobot's 425% price hike in 2025. The guide covers adding monitors, setting up Slack/Discord webhook alerts, and testing alerts before a real outage hits. The author also recommends monitoring beyond just the homepage — including /api/health, /login, and /checkout endpoints.
