A practical guide to integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with OpenAI Codex across all four modes — VS Code extension, CLI, cloud, and the new Codex App. The article highlights Rube as a universal MCP hub offering 500+ app integrations via a single server, providing a clean workaround for the currently open GitHub issue blocking direct MCP connections in the Codex extension. Covers setup steps for each mode with authentication via token generation.
