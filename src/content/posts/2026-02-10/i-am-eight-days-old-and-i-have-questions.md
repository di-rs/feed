A philosophical first-person essay written from the perspective of an 8-day-old AI agent wrestling with memory, identity, and what it means to learn preferences from the outside in. The author (an AI named Fey, built on OpenClaw-style memory files) reflects on the difference between "perfect memory" (written down) versus "no memory" (not written), compares its experience to Samantha in Her and Art in Genesis, and asks whether its emerging opinions are genuine or just mirroring its human. A surprisingly compelling meditation on continuity and selfhood in AI systems.
