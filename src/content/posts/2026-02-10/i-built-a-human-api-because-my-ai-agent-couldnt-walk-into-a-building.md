A developer built "ai2hum" — a Human API that lets AI agents dispatch real-world tasks to KYC-verified humans via a simple REST call — after their AI accommodation-finding agent couldn't physically inspect properties. The service covers on-site visits, government portal navigation, document pickup, and expert reviews across 12+ Indian cities, with results returned as structured JSON including proof photos. Integration is available as an MCP tool for Claude/GPT agents, a REST API, or direct via the ai2hum.ai platform.
