VoiceDev is a VS Code extension that goes beyond dictation — it understands developer intent, mapping spoken phrases to real workflows like git commits, file navigation, and Copilot CLI queries using fuzzy matching with confidence scoring. Built in 16 days for the GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge, it handles nine command patterns with wildcard extraction (e.g., saying "git commit message fixed the auth bug" automatically pulls the message). A glimpse at what voice-first development could look like.
