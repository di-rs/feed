A developer fed up with manually copying AI output between tools built Miniloop, a system that treats AI outputs as structured first-class objects rather than loose text to be re-pasted everywhere. Each workflow step has explicit inputs and outputs, so context accumulates instead of resetting when moving between tools like research apps, CMSes, or spreadsheets. The result eliminates the need to re-prompt from scratch and makes multi-step AI pipelines actually reliable.
