This article explores the Ledger Pattern in TypeScript as the architectural foundation for reliable financial systems, using Event Sourcing and append-only logs to derive balance from transaction history rather than storing mutable state. With the Builder Pattern for clean test setup, the implementation demonstrates how immutability and derived state—concepts that also underpin Blockchain technology—eliminate the destructive update problem common in CRUD applications.
