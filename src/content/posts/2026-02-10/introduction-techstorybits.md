TechStoryBits is a new DEV Community series that teaches technical concepts through stories, memes, and jokes — a neuro-hook approach designed to make certification-level material stick without feeling like studying. The author plans to post every 3 days, embedding concepts like AWS EC2 architecture into narratives so readers absorb the knowledge without realizing it. Think tech education with the curiosity level of the Penguins of Madagascar.
