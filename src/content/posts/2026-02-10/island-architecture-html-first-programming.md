Island Architecture pairs naturally with HTML-First programming by rendering mostly static HTML on the server and only hydrating interactive "islands" of JavaScript where needed, dramatically reducing payload size and improving latency. This approach maximizes cache hit ratios and leverages native web platform features while keeping developer experience (DX) straightforward. Together, these patterns push back against JavaScript-heavy SPAs, prioritizing user experience through minimal client-side overhead.
