SpecPilot is a lightweight, open-source CLI tool designed to make specification-driven development practical for everyday teams without heavy ceremony or enterprise platforms. It uses Markdown-friendly specs versioned alongside code, generates structured project scaffolds, and keeps documentation aligned with the codebase via terminal-first workflows. The tool targets small-to-mid-sized teams that want upfront clarity without slowing down execution or adopting complex tooling like full OpenAPI platforms.
