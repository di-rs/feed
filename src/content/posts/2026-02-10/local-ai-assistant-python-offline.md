A developer built a personal AI assistant that runs 100% locally without cloud APIs to understand how everything works under the hood. The assistant features per-user memory, voice replies with TTS, conversational chat, basic image understanding, and automatic language switching between English and Spanish. The project emphasizes learning and privacy by keeping all processing on the user's PC.
