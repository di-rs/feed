Manticore Search 17.5.1 is a maintenance release bringing bug fixes, minor improvements, and updated library versions. Highlights include MCL 10.0.0 support with a new DROP CACHE interface (breaking change), auto-embeddings support for Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemma models, and memory optimizations for Jieba morphology instances shared across tables. Percolate query JSON responses also switch _id and _score from strings to numbers to align with regular search behavior.
