Microsoft has attempted desktop widgets six times since 1997—Active Desktop, Vista Sidebar, Windows 7 Gadgets, Windows 8 Start Screen, and beyond—killing each iteration due to a different fatal flaw: performance collapse, security exploits, screen space complaints, and privacy concerns. Each failure triggered a more constrained successor, creating a cycle of "build, ship, backlash, kill, rebuild with more walls." The current widget architecture using declarative Adaptive Cards and a native WinUI 3 renderer is entirely shaped by lessons from these past disasters.
