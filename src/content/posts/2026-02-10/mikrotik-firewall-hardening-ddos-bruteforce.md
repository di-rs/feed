A production-tested cheat sheet for hardening MikroTik routers against DDoS attacks, SSH/Winbox brute-force, and port scanning when exposed to the internet. The guide covers structured firewall rules across input and forward chains, address-list-based protection logic, bruteforce detection strategy, safe rule ordering, and common configuration mistakes that silently break connectivity. Written from a real-world IT engineer's perspective with practical RouterOS rule examples.
