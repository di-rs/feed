Mockingoose is an open-source package for mocking Mongoose models in unit tests, now fully rewritten in TypeScript with support for both Jest and Vitest. It lets you simulate MongoDB operations like `findOne`, `updateOne`, and more without ever connecting to a real database. The TypeScript rewrite brings type safety and modern tooling to an already popular testing utility.
