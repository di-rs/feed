This comprehensive guide covers underutilized JavaScript features from ES2023-2024, including Promise.withResolvers() for cleaner async code, native Set operations, immutable array methods (toSorted, toReversed), Object.groupBy() to replace reduce boilerplate, and the powerful RegExp /v flag for Unicode. Stop writing 2018 JavaScript—these native features solve common problems more elegantly than workarounds you've been using for years.
