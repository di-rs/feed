In Moffatt v. Air Canada, a tribunal held the airline liable for a misleading chatbot response about bereavement fares, rejecting the argument that the bot was a "separate legal entity" from the company's official content. The ruling establishes that organizations are responsible for what their AI customer interfaces say, making this a critical precedent for any enterprise deploying AI-powered assistants. For CIOs and legal teams, the case is a blueprint for how regulators will treat AI outputs over the next decade.
