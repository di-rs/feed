A hands-on walkthrough of building a home network lab using a ThinkCentre M81 desktop and a Tenda AC1200 router, covering LAN setup, static IP configuration, DHCP reservations, and deploying an SSH-accessible Linux server running Nginx. The project demonstrates practical network engineering concepts using repurposed older hardware.
