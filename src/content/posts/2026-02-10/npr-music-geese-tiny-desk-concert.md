Indie rock band Geese performed an intimate Tiny Desk Concert at NPR Music, showcasing the quieter and more melancholic side of their 2025 album "Getting Killed." Frontperson Cameron Winter sang seated with Emily Green anchoring on guitar, with the stripped-back format highlighting the band's decade-long collaborative chemistry despite the buzz surrounding their recent release.
