oh-my-ag is a role-based agent orchestration layer for the Antigravity CLI that solves common single-agent problems like forgotten rules, infinite loops, and ignored skills by separating responsibilities across specialized agents (PM, Frontend, Backend, QA, Debug). A single `bunx oh-my-ag` command sets up the full agent team with shared memory context. It reflects the broader trend of moving from prompt-tuning to structured human-AI collaboration.
