A practical step-by-step guide to installing and configuring OpenClaw — the open-source, self-hosted AI assistant — from scratch on any always-on Linux machine in about 10 minutes. The guide covers hardware selection (Raspberry Pi 5, Intel N100 mini PC, Jetson Orin Nano ClawBox, or Mac Mini), Node.js setup, and connecting at least one messaging account (Telegram, WhatsApp, or Discord) plus an AI API key. ClawBox users get OpenClaw pre-installed and can skip most setup steps.
