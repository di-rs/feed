A quick-start guide for setting up OpenClaw, the open-source self-hosted AI assistant supporting Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, browser automation, and local AI inference. The walkthrough covers hardware selection (Raspberry Pi to Mac Mini M4), Node.js 20+ installation via nvm, and OpenClaw configuration — promising a working assistant in roughly 10 minutes, with ClawBox users able to skip straight to the final configuration step.
