This article presents a Temporal Graph Neural Network (T-GNN) architecture challenge for processing large-scale knowledge graphs with 10 million entities, 100 million edges, and 50 million temporal relationships. The design uses sparse matrix operations and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to keep inference time under 10 minutes for a batch of 1024 samples while accurately predicting temporal edge probabilities. The approach balances prediction accuracy (measured by AUC-ROC) with computational efficiency at scale.
