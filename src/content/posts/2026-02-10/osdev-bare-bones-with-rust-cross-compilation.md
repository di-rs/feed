A developer starts a series following the classic OSDev Bare Bones tutorial but using Rust instead of C, pairing it with modern concepts like cross-compilation for the i686-elf target. The article explains why a cross-compiler is essential for bare-metal kernel development — producing binaries with no OS assumptions — and how Rust's toolchain handles freestanding environments. It's a practical entry point for anyone wanting to explore OS development with a modern systems language.
