After UptimeRobot's 425% price hike in July 2025 ($8 → $34/month), the uptime monitoring market reshuffled. This comparison pits OwlPulse ($9/mo, unlimited monitors, SMS included) against StatusCake ($20.41/mo, 10-monitor free tier, dated UI) and Pingdom ($15/mo, no free tier, enterprise-grade RUM). The verdict: OwlPulse wins on value for indie hackers and small teams, StatusCake if you're already on it, and Pingdom for enterprises needing RUM or SolarWinds compliance.
