A practical breakdown of running an always-on personal AI assistant server under 15W using an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (ClawBox). The author compares electricity costs across devices — from Raspberry Pi 5 (€0.90-1.44/month) to GPU desktops (€30+/month) — and explains why the Jetson's 67 TOPS of AI compute, fanless passive cooling, and under €3/month power cost make it ideal for 24/7 AI workloads.
