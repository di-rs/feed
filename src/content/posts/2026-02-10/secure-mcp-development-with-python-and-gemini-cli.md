A walkthrough for building a minimal, secure Model Context Protocol (MCP) stdio server in Python and validating it locally with the Gemini CLI, using pyenv for consistent Python 3.13 version management. The guide emphasizes a minimal Hello World MCP server first — no unnecessary extensions — before layering in more functionality, keeping the development baseline clean and understandable. Provides an incremental approach to MCP development that keeps the client (Gemini CLI) and server running in the same local environment for fast iteration.
