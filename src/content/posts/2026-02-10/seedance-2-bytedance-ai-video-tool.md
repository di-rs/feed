ByteDance's Seedance 2.0 (launched February 8, 2026 in limited beta via Jimeng/Dreamina) is a multimodal AI video generator that accepts up to 9 images, 3 video clips, and 3 audio files simultaneously to produce 2K watermark-free video up to 15 seconds. Its standout "reference capability" lets creators control visual style, camera motion, and even lip-sync across 8+ languages using an intuitive @mention system — making it feel more like a director's tool than a prompt roulette. Early users report it completing in minutes tasks that took human collaborators a full day.
