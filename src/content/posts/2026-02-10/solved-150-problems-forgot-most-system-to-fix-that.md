A developer built a personal LeetCode tracking system after realizing vanilla solve counters don't tell you interview readiness or weak spots. The system supports curated lists (Blind 75, NeetCode 150, etc.), spaced-repetition reviews, self-assessment beyond binary solved/unsolved, and analytics to identify weak topic areas.
