Spring CRUD Generator v1.1.0 introduces field-level validation rules (required, length, pattern, range), fixes Redis caching with HibernateLazyNullModule for lazy-loaded entities, and resolves compatibility issues to fully support both Spring Boot 3 and Spring Boot 4. EntityGraph support is also added for better behavior when OSIV is disabled.
