A beginner-friendly walkthrough of database normalization and denormalization, explaining all three normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) with concrete table examples showing how to eliminate data redundancy and prevent update anomalies. Normalization splits data into related tables linked via primary and foreign keys, while denormalization deliberately reintroduces redundancy for read performance in specific use cases. The article helps developers understand when to choose each approach based on their application's read/write patterns.
