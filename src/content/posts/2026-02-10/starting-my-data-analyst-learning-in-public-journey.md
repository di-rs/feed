A developer publicly committing to a structured 12-week data analyst learning journey, documenting everything from Python and SQL fundamentals to Power BI dashboards and real-world case studies. The roadmap progresses from Python basics and Pandas data analysis (weeks 1–2), through statistics and EDA (weeks 3–4), SQL basics and advanced queries (weeks 5–6), and into Power BI fundamentals and DAX (weeks 7–8). The learning-in-public approach is framed as a consistency and accountability mechanism rather than a showcase.
