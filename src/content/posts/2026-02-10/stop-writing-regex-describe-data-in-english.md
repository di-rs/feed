Instead of brittle regex patterns, the everyrow Python SDK lets you define fuzzy, qualitative filtering criteria in plain English and apply them to every row of a dataframe via LLM orchestration. This approach handles ambiguous, unstructured data — like job postings with inconsistent formatting — far better than deterministic rules. The SDK manages structured outputs and scaling automatically, letting developers describe intent rather than write parsing logic.
