A DEV Education Track submission showcasing a full productivity app built entirely through Google AI Studio's Gemini-powered code assistant. The app implements 12 time management techniques — including Pomodoro, Eisenhower Matrix, and GTD — with interactive Kanban boards, a focus tracker, weekly insights dashboard, and offline-first local storage. The entire app structure and UI components were generated via a single detailed prompt.
