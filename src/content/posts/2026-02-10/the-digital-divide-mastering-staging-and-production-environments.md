Maintaining separate staging and production environments is essential for software quality — it lets teams test features and fixes without risking the live application. Best practices covered include using separate Git branches per environment, implementing automated unit/integration/e2e tests in staging, adopting CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins, and managing environment-specific configuration separately. This separation ensures only stable, thoroughly tested code ever reaches production users.
