The OWASP Lettuce Project was born from a simple observation: every year, newcomers to OWASP ask "where do I begin?" and there was no easy answer. Jason and the author built a Slack-based welcome bot that guides newcomers with a curated path through OWASP's ecosystem, quietly onboarding nearly 6,000 people since its launch in June 2024 with no marketing. The project's origin story highlights how a simple, utility-focused tool can have real impact when placed exactly where users already are.
