An allegorical short story following "the Zebra," a process engineer arriving at a dysfunctional organization called Automora — filled with empty documentation frameworks, hollow slogans, and performative alignment rituals. Episode II continues the fictional narrative exploring corporate bureaucratic theater, where polished binders contain blank pages and "asynchronous collaboration" means no one is actually working. A sharp, creative commentary on organizations that prefer the appearance of process over its substance.
