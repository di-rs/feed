A review of Kent Beck's book on "tidying" - small, incremental refactorings that nobody could hate - distinguishing it from larger refactoring efforts that pause feature development. The book explores the relationship between tidyings and coupling-cohesion design properties, presenting Constantine's Equivalence that links software cost to big changes caused by coupling. Beck addresses the crucial timing question of when to tidy (before, during, or after behavior changes), emphasizing the economic tradeoffs between paying the cost of coupling now versus investing in decoupling for future benefits.
