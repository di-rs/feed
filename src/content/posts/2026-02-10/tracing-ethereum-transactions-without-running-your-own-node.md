Running a full Ethereum tracing node (debug_traceTransaction, trace_*) is expensive and slow, leaving many teams without visibility into transaction execution during incidents. The Ktzchen Web3 Trace API provides a managed interface for inspecting execution flow, internal calls, gas usage, and revert reasons via Snap-sync nodes optimized for recent blocks — no self-hosted infrastructure required. This makes transaction debugging and monitoring accessible for bot developers, backend teams, and DeFi builders without the overhead of a full archive node.
