Part 5 of a series building a privacy-first, offline-first Pain Tracker app, this post argues that accessibility shouldn't be an afterthought — it's a foundational architectural decision, especially for users with chronic pain, brain fog, and tremor.

A thoughtful take on accessibility-as-reliability rather than accessibility-as-compliance.
