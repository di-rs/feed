The author dives deep into how NestJS providers and dependency injection actually work under the hood, going beyond the routine of "just registering them in a module." Using a practical restaurant app example, the post explains the difference between instantiating dependencies directly versus injecting them, and how Nest builds an application graph to resolve relationships. A clear explanation for developers who use NestJS daily but want to truly understand the why behind the pattern.
