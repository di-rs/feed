A comprehensive guide to React's Context API, explaining how it solves prop drilling by allowing data to be shared across components without passing props through every level. The article covers when to use Context (for global-ish values like authentication, themes, or app settings), demonstrates building a theme switcher with the provider pattern, and shows how to implement type-safe Context in TypeScript. Context API is ideal for state that many components need, though props remain better for simple parent-child communication.
