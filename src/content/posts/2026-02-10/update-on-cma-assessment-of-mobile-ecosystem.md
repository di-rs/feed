The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has announced its intention to accept Google's voluntary commitments to resolve concerns about its mobile ecosystem. Google's proposed commitments focus on providing greater transparency around Google Play's app review, ranking, and data usage policies so developers better understand their options. Google's mobile ecosystem contributes over £9.9 billion in revenue for UK developers and supports over 457,000 jobs.
