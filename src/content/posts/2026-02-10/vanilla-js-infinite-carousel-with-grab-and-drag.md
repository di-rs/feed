An introduction to Grab-n-Drag Infinite Carousel, a lightweight 30KB vanilla JavaScript library for creating smooth infinite scrolling carousels with natural momentum physics and touch/mobile support. The library has zero dependencies, ships with full TypeScript definitions, and supports event callbacks for custom logic — making it a clean choice for logo showcases, skill displays, and product galleries without pulling in a full UI framework.
