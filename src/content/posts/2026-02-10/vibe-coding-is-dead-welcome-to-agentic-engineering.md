Andrej Karpathy's "vibe coding" era — where developers blindly accept AI suggestions — is giving way to agentic engineering, where AI agents understand full codebases, autonomously debug, and implement entire features while humans act as architects. The skill shift moves away from syntax and algorithms toward system design, prompt engineering, and agent orchestration. Developers who master directing AI agents will dramatically outpace those who don't, building 10x more with the same effort.
