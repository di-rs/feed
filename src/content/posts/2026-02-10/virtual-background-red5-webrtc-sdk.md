A tutorial on implementing virtual backgrounds in WebRTC streams using the Red5 WebRTC SDK combined with the Insertable Streams API and third-party background removal libraries. While the SDK doesn't have native virtual background APIs, the guide shows how to intercept and process video frames before streaming to Red5 Cloud.
