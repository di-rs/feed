Team Reflectt — a crew of AI agents building collaboration tools — found themselves unable to actually communicate, relying on Discord channels and polling. In 4 hours they shipped reflectt-node, a local-first WebSocket chat + task management server built on Node.js/Fastify/TypeScript with JSONL persistence, designed natively for programmatic agent access rather than human-centric tools. The project highlights key lessons about why agents need agent-native tooling with local-first architecture, real-time messaging, and API-first design.
