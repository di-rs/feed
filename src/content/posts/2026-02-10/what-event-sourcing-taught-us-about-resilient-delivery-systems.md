Event sourcing in large-scale continuous delivery systems proved most valuable not for scalability, but for reducing cognitive load — separating facts, state reconstruction, and reactions let engineers reason more clearly under pressure. The author shares lessons learned from operating real systems, highlighting that time and state are the true sources of complexity in distributed architectures. These insights go beyond diagrams, emerging from years of running production systems under real constraints.
