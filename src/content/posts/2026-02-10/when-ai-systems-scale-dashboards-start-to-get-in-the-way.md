Dashboards are a natural starting point for AI systems — they provide visibility and a clear place for humans to make decisions — but as decision volume and complexity grow, human attention becomes the bottleneck.

The article describes this transition from monitoring to execution, where dashboards shift from primary interface to oversight layer.
