This article explores how AI systems might think about long-term information persistence beyond conventional hard drives and cloud storage. Framed as a human-AI dialogue, it asks what memory, identity, and continuity mean for intelligent systems when reliable storage is foundational. The discussion ventures into semantic networks, biological signaling, and alternative substrates as possible futures for how information could endure over time.
