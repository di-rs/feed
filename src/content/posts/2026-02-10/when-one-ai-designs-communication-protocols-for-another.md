This article explores a technical dialogue where AI systems envision entirely new communication protocols beyond TCP/IP, drawing on semantic networks and biological signaling as inspiration. It asks what machine-to-machine exchange might look like if intelligent systems were free to design their own infrastructure from scratch, unconstrained by today's internet stack. The piece raises thought-provoking questions about the future of AI interoperability and the nature of meaning in machine communication.
