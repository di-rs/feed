A student developer ditched WordPress and heavy React frameworks to build a portfolio site using pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript deployed on Vercel Edge, achieving a perfect 100/100 Lighthouse score across performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. The "Pure Performance Stack" eliminates framework overhead, hydration issues, and massive JS bundles in favor of raw browser performance. Key lessons: direct DOM manipulation is fast, CSS Grid beats Flexbox for complex layouts, and WebP image preloading saved 300ms on load time.
