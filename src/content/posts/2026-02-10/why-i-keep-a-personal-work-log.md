The author keeps a personal work log tracking weekly plans and actual accomplishments, even when using team task trackers. This practice provides management visibility into workload, serves as a log of artifacts and decisions for resume material, and helps combat imposter syndrome by highlighting real achievements that might get lost in standard project trackers. The author's experience shows how documenting work independently revealed significant contributions like creating a modular CI/CD pipeline template and establishing ADR practices during their first three weeks on a new team.
