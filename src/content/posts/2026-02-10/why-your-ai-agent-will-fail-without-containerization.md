Running AI agents as monolithic applications is a recipe for failure at scale — the article argues that cloud-native microservices architecture is the only viable path for production AI workloads. It breaks down how to decompose an AI app into specialized services (ingestion, model inference, post-processing, orchestration) and provides a technical blueprint for containerizing agents with Kubernetes and C#. The shift enables independent scaling, fault isolation, and resilient inference pipelines.
