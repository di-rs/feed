A step-by-step Portuguese guide for setting up WireGuard VPN on the TP-Link Omada ER605 router, covering interface creation on the router, client key pair generation, and configuration of split tunnel vs. full tunnel routing. The guide explains when to use a static IP endpoint vs. DDNS (essential for dynamic residential IPs) and walks through all critical fields like MTU, listen port, and AllowedIPs. A solid modern alternative to OpenVPN or L2TP for homelab VPN setups.
