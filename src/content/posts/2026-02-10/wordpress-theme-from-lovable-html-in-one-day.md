A developer took an AI-generated React/Vite SPA from Lovable and used Claude Code to convert it into a full WordPress theme in a single day — producing 83 files and 7,300+ lines of code with 11 custom blocks and 4 custom post types. The workflow involved having Claude analyze the entire React codebase, map design tokens and components, then generate the equivalent PHP/WordPress structures. Without AI assistance, the same conversion would have taken at least a week.
