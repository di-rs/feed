Anthropic deployed 16 Claude Opus instances to autonomously build a C compiler in Rust — no human supervision, two weeks, ~$20,000 in compute tokens — resulting in 100,000 lines of code capable of compiling the Linux kernel. The agents handled the full software development lifecycle including architecture, implementation, testing, and self-correction of bugs without any human intervention. This experiment signals a shift from AI as "copilot" toward AI as autonomous engineering teams, with human developers transitioning to high-level architect and reviewer roles.
