LogRocket presents a four-phase framework for optimizing React apps: bundle analysis, code splitting and lazy loading, render optimization (memoization, virtualization), and server-side rendering. Using a video player app as a case study, the guide shows how this systematic approach can cut Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) from 28 seconds to under 1 second — a 93%+ improvement — without sacrificing code quality or developer experience. The article emphasizes establishing Chrome DevTools performance baselines before making any changes, and includes a companion video and code repo.
