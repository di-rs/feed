The author argues that Agile's two-week sprints and story points are relics in a world where AI agents can generate features, write tests, review code, and deploy in minutes — often in parallel swarms. They propose an "Agentic Manifesto" built on four values: human intent over exhaustive requirements, continuous flow over rigid sprints, architectural integrity over sheer output, and automated validation over manual estimation. With Gartner predicting 40% of enterprise apps embedding task-specific agents by year's end, the shift from Agile to "Architected Intent" feels inevitable.
