BoxFinder is an iOS app built with SwiftUI and SwiftData that helps users track physical storage containers using photos and searchable item tags—solving the classic "which box is that in?" problem. The author used GitHub Copilot CLI to accelerate development from a product spec through core screens including box creation, item management, and keyword search. The project demonstrates how AI coding tools can help solo developers ship a complete iOS MVP more efficiently.
