BugSnippet-Vault is a minimalist black-and-white dashboard for tracking technical debt, built with GitHub Copilot for the CLI Challenge, featuring bug cards with GitHub URL linking, status toggling (Open/Closed), and real-time resolution analytics. Each bug entry displays a randomly generated "Cryptic Wisdom" phrase — motivational mottos like "Errors are lessons in disguise" — that reframe debugging as a growth opportunity rather than a failure. The project uses localStorage for persistence and is deployed on Netlify, embodying a philosophy that every bug fixed builds a stronger developer.
