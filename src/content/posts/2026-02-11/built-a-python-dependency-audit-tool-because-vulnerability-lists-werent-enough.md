AuditDeps is a CLI tool that goes beyond simple CVE lists by generating structured, audit-friendly reports (JSON/HTML) for Python projects, querying OSV.dev for vulnerability data and producing evidence-ready artifacts with scope, provenance, and context. Unlike quick-check tools like pip-audit, AuditDeps focuses on what comes after detection — making results reviewable, repeatable, and explainable for formal security reviews and compliance audits. It scans `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`, and is ideal for teams that need archived, consistent audit artifacts rather than ephemeral scan output.
