Draughts Pro is an online multiplayer checkers app built for the GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge, supporting 7 languages and 4 game variants (International, American/British, Brazilian, Nigerian) with adaptive AI at 4 difficulty levels. The developer used GitHub Copilot CLI as a pair programmer to bridge knowledge gaps in FastAPI and Python, staying in flow without constant context-switching to documentation. Live at draughts.pro, the project demonstrates how AI-assisted development enables building confidently outside one's technical comfort zone.
