In January 2026, GitHub experienced two notable incidents affecting service availability. On January 13, a configuration error during a GPT-4.1 model update caused GitHub Copilot to suffer up to 100% error rates for 46 minutes across Chat, VS Code, and JetBrains IDEs. A second incident on January 15 brought increased latency and timeouts across issues, pull requests, Actions, and API endpoints for about 1 hour 40 minutes. GitHub has since implemented stronger monitors and configuration safeguards to prevent recurrence.
