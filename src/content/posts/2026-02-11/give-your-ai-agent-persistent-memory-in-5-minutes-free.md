MemoClaw is a memory API for AI agents that solves the stateless session problem by providing semantic (meaning-based) search, wallet-based identity, and 1000 free API calls per wallet — no database setup or account creation required. Using any EVM wallet as your identity, the CLI stores vector embeddings of memories scoped to your wallet address, enabling agents to recall context by meaning rather than keywords across sessions. The tutorial demonstrates storing and recalling user preferences in under 5 minutes using Node.js 18+ and a simple CLI workflow.
