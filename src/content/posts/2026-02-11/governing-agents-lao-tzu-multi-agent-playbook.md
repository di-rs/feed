A second-year Data Science student draws a parallel between Lao Tzu's "govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish" and the emerging wisdom of multi-agent AI orchestration — minimal interference, clear intent, and letting systems do their work. The piece uses a viral Reddit story of Claude Code spawning three coordinated agents to complete a full-stack project in 15 minutes as a jumping-off point, weaving in the author's own fumbling experiments with OpenClaw and lessons about over-managing AI agents. A thoughtful, humanizing take on the 2026 agentic AI moment.
