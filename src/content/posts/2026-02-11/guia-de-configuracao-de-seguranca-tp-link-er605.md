A guide (in Portuguese) to hardening the TP-Link ER605 router for a homelab environment, covering ARP spoofing defense, flood protection (TCP SYN, UDP, ICMP), and packet anomaly blocking. The author walks through enabling GARP packets, setting per-second packet limits to prevent DoS attacks, and making the router invisible to port scanners via TCP Scan and Ping-from-WAN blocking. A practical layer-by-layer approach to router security for home infrastructure enthusiasts.
