OpenAI's internal team built a production software product with 0 lines of manually-written code over five months, using only Codex agents — resulting in ~1 million lines of code, ~1,500 merged PRs, and an average of 3.5 PRs per engineer per day. The experiment revealed that the primary bottleneck in agentic development shifts from writing code to designing environments, specifying intent clearly, and building feedback loops that enable reliable agent execution. The team estimates they built in approximately 1/10th the time it would have taken to write code by hand, with throughput increasing as the team grew.
