Octrafic is an open-source CLI tool that lets developers describe API tests in plain English and have AI execute them against an OpenAPI spec. It's built in Go as a single binary with no runtime dependencies, supports multiple LLM providers (Claude, OpenAI, Ollama, llama.cpp), and uses Bubble Tea for an interactive terminal UI. Rather than writing Postman scripts or wrestling with curl syntax, users load their API spec and simply describe what they want tested.
