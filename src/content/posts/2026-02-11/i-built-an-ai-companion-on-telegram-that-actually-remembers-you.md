The author built Adola, a persistent AI companion Telegram bot that remembers past conversations by storing and summarizing them into a user profile. Unlike typical AI chatbots that reset each session, Adola uses Gemini Flash for inference and PostgreSQL for storage, enabling proactive check-ins based on past conversation context. It runs on Telegram for zero-friction cross-platform access with no new app required.
