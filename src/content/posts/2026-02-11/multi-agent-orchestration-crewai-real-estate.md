This post explores using CrewAI to automate real estate market research by splitting the problem into specialized agent roles — a Market Researcher identifying promising cities and a Property Listing Specialist evaluating actual listings — where outputs from one agent feed into the next. The author demonstrates how decomposing a broad prompt into agent-specific tasks improves reasoning clarity and execution reliability compared to a single large prompt. Built with Google Gemini and LangChain, it's a practical intro to sequential multi-agent workflows for real-world data-heavy tasks.
