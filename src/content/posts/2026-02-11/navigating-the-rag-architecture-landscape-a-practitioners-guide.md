RAG has evolved from a single pattern into a rich ecosystem including Naive RAG, HyDE, Corrective RAG, Adaptive RAG, and more, each suited for different accuracy and scalability tradeoffs. This practitioner's guide explains how each pattern works, when to use it, and where it fails—helping engineers pick the right architecture for their specific use case. Choosing the right RAG pattern rather than defaulting to the simplest approach is key to building reliable AI-powered retrieval systems.
