SLIs (Service Level Indicators) measure how a service actually behaves from a user's perspective—like latency and error rates—while SLOs (Service Level Objectives) set internal targets for acceptable performance, and SLAs are formal contracts with customers backed by error budgets. Together they form the core vocabulary of Site Reliability Engineering and guide decisions about what to fix, when to invest in reliability, and when to ship new features. The article emphasizes that targeting perfection (100% uptime) is counterproductive; sustainable reliability means managing an error budget wisely.
