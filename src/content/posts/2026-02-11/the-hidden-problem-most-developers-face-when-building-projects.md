Most developers fail not from lack of skill but from lack of architecture discipline — they build fast without defining contracts, failure modes, and isolation boundaries, resulting in fragile systems they're afraid to touch. The article argues for shifting from a "builder" mindset focused on features and speed to an "architect" mindset that asks "how does this fail?" and "what are the execution limits?" Using GozoLite as an example, it shows that defining explicit execution contracts and resource limits leads to more resilient, predictable systems — where stability beats speed in B2B contexts.
