The February 11th edition of The Replay newsletter rounds up key frontend stories: cutting React LCP from 28s to ~1s using profiling, smart bundling, and SSR; Rich Harris unpacking fine-grained reactivity and what comes after React Server Components; and building privacy-first AI agents with local-first small language models. A solid weekly digest for dev and engineering leaders tracking the evolving frontend landscape.
