A data-driven breakdown of why hiring senior developers at $150/hr often costs less than junior devs at $30/hr once rework, bug fixes, and management overhead are factored in — narrowing the effective cost gap to $175 vs $90-100/hr. Applying Boehm's Rule of 100, the post shows that bugs fixed in production cost 1000x more than those caught at design, and seniors "fix" bugs before writing them. Notably, a 2025 Fastly survey found seniors ship 2.5x more AI-assisted code than juniors because they can validate AI output, meaning AI amplifies — not closes — the senior-junior skill gap.
