A controls engineer with 15 years of automotive ECU development (traction control, quickshift systems) explains why they use just 2 AI layers — a Design AI for specifications and Claude Code for implementation — instead of the typical 5-layer stack used by software engineers. In safety-critical domains where bugs can injure riders, deliberate sequential verification matters more than parallel background agents or AI-first IDEs. The article challenges the "100x engineer" framework by showing that the right AI workflow is entirely domain-specific, governed by risk tolerance and verification requirements.
