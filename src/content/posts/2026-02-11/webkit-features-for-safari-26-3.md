Safari 26.3 ships several notable improvements for web developers: Zstandard (Zstd) compression support for faster asset delivery, Navigation API enhancements that make it easier to cancel ongoing navigations in single-page applications, and automatic fullscreen video dimming in visionOS. The release also fixes issues with anchor positioning and multi-column layouts, improving robustness for developers using these features. Zstd support is available on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS Tahoe 26.3 via the system networking stack.
