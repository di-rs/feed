Apple, Google, Igalia, Microsoft, and Mozilla have announced Interop 2026, the fifth consecutive year of the cross-browser initiative aimed at making web technologies consistent and reliable across all major browsers. The 2026 focus areas include anchor positioning, container style queries, scroll-driven animations, view transitions, the Navigation API, WebRTC, WebTransport, and CSS zoom — many of which Safari has already implemented. Interop 2025 closed with an overall interop score of 95 (up from 25), enabling major web platform features like CSS Anchor Positioning and Same-Document View Transitions to become cross-browser realities.
