Google has released a major upgrade to Gemini 3 Deep Think, its specialized reasoning mode built for tackling tough science, research, and engineering challenges where problems often lack clear guardrails or complete data. Early testers include researchers at Rutgers, Duke, and Vanderbilt who used it to identify flaws in peer-reviewed papers, generate novel experimental hypotheses, and solve complex engineering problems. Google AI Ultra subscribers can access the updated Deep Think in the Gemini app now, with API early access available for researchers and enterprises.
