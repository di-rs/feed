Google's Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has released a report documenting how threat actors are increasingly leveraging AI to gather intelligence, craft hyper-realistic phishing campaigns, and develop malware. While no direct attacks on frontier AI models from advanced persistent threat (APT) actors have been observed, GTIG has detected and mitigated frequent model extraction attacks — a form of corporate espionage — from private sector entities worldwide. Google has responded by disabling associated accounts, strengthening security controls, and hardening its Gemini models against misuse.
