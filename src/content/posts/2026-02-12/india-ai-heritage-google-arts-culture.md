Ahead of the India AI Impact Summit, Google Arts & Culture launched three AI-powered experiences celebrating India's heritage: "Talking Tours - India Edition" using Gemini for interactive dialogues with 200+ historical sites, "Moving Scripts - Sanskrit Devanagari Edition" that visualizes Sanskrit letters with AI video/image models, and "Sanskrit Lens" — a digital artwork by Harshit Agrawal. These projects build on a decade of Google partnerships showcasing Indian art and culture online.
