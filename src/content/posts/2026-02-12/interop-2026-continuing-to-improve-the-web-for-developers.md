Interop 2026 has been announced — a collaborative effort by Apple, Google, Igalia, Microsoft, and Mozilla to improve cross-browser compatibility of key web platform features. Focus areas for 2026 include anchor positioning, container style queries, dialogs and popovers, scroll-driven animations, view transitions, the attr() CSS function, and more. Progress can be tracked on the Interop 2026 dashboard at wpt.fyi/interop-2026.
