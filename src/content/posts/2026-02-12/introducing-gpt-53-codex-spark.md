OpenAI has released a research preview of GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark, a smaller, ultra-low-latency coding model built in partnership with Cerebras that delivers over 1,000 tokens per second — making it feel near-instant for interactive coding tasks. Unlike frontier Codex models optimized for long-running autonomous tasks, Codex-Spark is designed for real-time collaboration: making targeted edits, reshaping logic, and iterating on code with immediate feedback. It's currently available to ChatGPT Pro users with a 128k context window during the research preview.
