Cloudflare has introduced real-time HTML-to-Markdown conversion at the network edge, allowing AI agents and crawlers to receive structured Markdown directly from websites instead of raw HTML — reducing token usage by up to 80%. As AI traffic increasingly rivals traditional search engine traffic, businesses need to treat agents as first-class citizens in their content delivery strategy, and Markdown has become the lingua franca for AI systems due to its explicit structure and minimal token footprint. The feature is built into Cloudflare's network and requires no changes to origin servers.
