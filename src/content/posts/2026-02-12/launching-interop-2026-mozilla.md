Mozilla has announced the launch of Interop 2026, the cross-browser collaboration with Apple, Google, Igalia, and Microsoft to improve web platform consistency. Interop 2025 was a landmark success — Firefox's interop score rose from 46 to 99, and the overall combined score jumped from 25 to 95, delivering cross-browser support for View Transitions, CSS Anchor Positioning, and the Navigation API. The 2026 focus areas include scroll-driven animations, shape(), scoped custom element registries, and WebTransport, building on the strong foundation from 2025.
