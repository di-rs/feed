Google highlights three Pixel features that break language barriers during Lunar New Year travel: Live Translate for real-time messaging translation in 20+ languages, Gemini Live's camera-sharing for visual translation of handwritten notes and menus, and Circle to Search for instant on-screen text translation. These tools make it easier to connect with family and navigate unfamiliar environments during the holiday season.
