GitHub has launched Agentic Workflows in technical preview — a system that brings coding agents into GitHub Actions to automate repository tasks like issue triage, CI failure investigation, documentation updates, and test improvements. Workflows are authored in plain Markdown and executed with coding agents, keeping humans in control of when and where AI acts. Designed for individuals up to enterprise teams, Agentic Workflows aim to make AI-powered repository automation scalable and inspectable across millions of repositories.
