OpenAI has published a preprint showing that GPT-5.2 helped derive a new result in theoretical physics, demonstrating that single-minus gluon tree amplitudes — previously assumed to be zero — can in fact be nonzero in a specific "half-collinear" momentum regime. The work, co-authored with researchers from IAS, Vanderbilt, Cambridge, and Harvard, challenges a standard textbook assumption in quantum field theory. The preprint is available on arXiv and has been submitted for peer review.
