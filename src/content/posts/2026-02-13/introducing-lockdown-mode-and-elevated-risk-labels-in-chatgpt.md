OpenAI is introducing two new security features to help protect against prompt injection attacks: Lockdown Mode and Elevated Risk labels. Lockdown Mode is an optional advanced setting for high-risk users (such as executives and security teams) that tightly constrains how ChatGPT interacts with external systems — for example, limiting web browsing to cached content only. Elevated Risk labels flag capabilities in ChatGPT, ChatGPT Atlas, and Codex that may introduce additional security risk, giving organizations clearer visibility into potential vulnerabilities.
