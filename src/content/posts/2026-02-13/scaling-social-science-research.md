OpenAI's Economic Research Team has released GABRIEL, an open-source toolkit that uses GPT to convert unstructured text and images into quantitative measurements at scale. The tool allows researchers to describe what they want to measure in plain language and apply that question consistently across millions of documents, dramatically reducing time spent on repetitive data labeling. GABRIEL is designed to make qualitative social science data — from syllabi and interviews to social media and photographs — far more accessible for rigorous analysis.
