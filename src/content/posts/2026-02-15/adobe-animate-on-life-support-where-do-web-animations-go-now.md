Adobe announced Animate's discontinuation in February 2026, reversed into "maintenance mode" after massive backlash — essentially a slow death with no new features ever coming. Adobe's suggested alternatives (After Effects Puppet tool, Adobe Express) don't cover Animate's core use cases like bone-based character rigging, frame-by-frame animation timelines, or interactive content publishing. The web animation community is now actively evaluating true alternatives and planning their exit from the platform.
