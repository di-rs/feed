Agentic TMUX MCP is a multi-agent orchestration system for GitHub Copilot CLI that runs parallel AI agents in separate tmux panes, enabling direct agent-to-agent communication via SQLite message queues — no central coordinator bottleneck. One prompt is all it takes: you describe the work, agents split it up, assign tasks, and collect results while you watch each agent's thought process live. This eliminates the context-window inflation of traditional orchestrator-centric architectures where every message must be relayed through a middleman.
