A DevOps engineer built a CLI tool called "AI-Powered Infra Doc Generator" that reads Terraform files, YAML configs, and Dockerfiles, then uses GitHub Copilot CLI to auto-generate structured documentation including architecture overviews, security risk analyses, cost optimization suggestions, and Mermaid diagrams. The tool transforms infrastructure-as-code into enterprise-grade docs in seconds, eliminating the chronic documentation lag in DevOps workflows. Key insight: prompt engineering in Copilot CLI — asking structured questions rather than vague ones — was the game-changer.
