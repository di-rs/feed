App Release Copilot is a chat-style CLI tool for indie iOS developers that generates AI-powered App Store Optimization (ASO) metadata — titles, subtitles, keywords, descriptions — directly from the terminal using the GitHub Copilot SDK. It features live MCP-powered keyword traffic/difficulty scoring, character-limit-aware color coding, competitor App Store listing import, and even AI-generated app icons via OpenAI or Gemini, with support for multiple Copilot models including GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet.
