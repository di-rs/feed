Aurora OS.js is an open-source web-based hacking simulator game built with React, Vite, and Electron, currently in pre-Alpha and designed as the foundation for a future MMO hacking universe. The project blurs the line between a functional operating system and an immersive cyberpunk game world, featuring a scripting environment, virtual apps, terminal interfaces, and sandboxed gameplay. It's set in the mental.os() universe with plans to evolve into a persistent multiplayer world.
