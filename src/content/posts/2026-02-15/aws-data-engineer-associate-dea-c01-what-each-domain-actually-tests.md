A developer who passed the AWS DEA-C01 exam with a score of 824 shares a domain-by-domain breakdown of the 65-question, 130-minute test. Domain 1 (Data Ingestion & Transformation, 34%) demands deep knowledge of Glue, Kinesis, Lambda, and DMS, while Domain 2 (Data Store Management, 26%) tests your ability to pick the right storage — S3, Redshift, DynamoDB, or RDS — for each scenario. The exam is technical and humbling; hands-on practice with real data pipelines is more valuable than conceptual study alone.
