binmate is a CLI/TUI application built in Go that lets you install, manage, and switch between different versions of command-line tools sourced directly from GitHub releases — solving the problem of outdated packages in system repositories like apt. It features an interactive terminal UI (Bubble Tea), checksum verification, and SQLite-based installation tracking, making it a universal version manager for any binary distributed via GitHub.
