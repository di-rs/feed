DOC-PILOT is a Gemini-powered CLI documentation assistant that eliminates context-switching by surfacing library documentation, method explanations, and code samples directly in the terminal — no browser needed. Built as a GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge submission, the entire tool was assembled in 2.5 hours through a conversation with Copilot starting from only a brain-dump instructions file, without writing a single line of boilerplate manually. It keeps developers in flow state by making documentation instantly accessible within the terminal environment.
