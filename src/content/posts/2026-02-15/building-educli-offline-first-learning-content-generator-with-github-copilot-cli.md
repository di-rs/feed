EduCLI is a command-line tool that generates offline-ready learning materials — HTML lessons, lesson plans, and quizzes — from simple natural-language commands, built to address limited internet access in regions like Mozambique. A single command creates a ready-to-use learning package with an HTML page, teacher script, and quiz JSON that can run locally or on a local network. Built as a GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge submission, it aims to democratize digital content creation for technical education.
