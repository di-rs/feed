A Mahashivratri-inspired reflection on how the Hindu concept of Shiva as destroyer maps to software development: refactoring is "Tandava" — eliminating messy code, bad habits, and self-doubt to create something cleaner and stronger. The post draws parallels between Shiva's attributes (meditative focus, energetic creation, calm under pressure, wisdom) and the daily mindset needed to write better software. Short and philosophical, it's a reminder that destruction of the old is necessary for meaningful progress.
