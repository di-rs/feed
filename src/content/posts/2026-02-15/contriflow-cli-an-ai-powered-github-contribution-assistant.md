ContriFlow CLI is an AI-powered terminal tool that helps developers — especially beginners — contribute to open source by discovering beginner-friendly GitHub issues, automating fork/clone/upstream setup, generating AI-powered solution suggestions via OpenRouter, and gamifying the process with streaks, XP, badges, and daily contribution challenges. It handles the entire contribution workflow from issue discovery to PR management in one unified CLI.
