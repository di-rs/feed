A developer built three Terminal User Interface (TUI) applications with GitHub Copilot CLI: a cyberpunk network monitor visualizing Docker containers as ASCII topology with Matrix rain effects, a "Code Bonsai" git visualizer that grows an ASCII tree reflecting code health and commit activity, and a "Cozy Cabin" terminal wallpaper with live weather, a battery-status cat, a RAM plant, and a CPU fireplace. The project evolved from a rigid agent-based approach to a fluid context-engineering workflow, showing how Copilot can transform CLI development from functional to genuinely creative. Each app demonstrates unique ways to make system state visible through terminal aesthetics.
