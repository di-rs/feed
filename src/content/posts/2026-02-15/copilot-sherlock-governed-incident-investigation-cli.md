Copilot Sherlock wraps GitHub Copilot inside a strict governance lifecycle for production incident investigation: AI proposes competing hypotheses with evidence and confidence scores, humans explicitly decide (ACCEPT/MODIFY/REJECT), and the system enforces authority through lifecycle gates and cryptographically verifiable, append-only audit records. Unlike most AI tools that give unstructured suggestions without accountability, Sherlock separates intelligence from decision authority. The result is a production-grade pattern where AI never decides — humans always do, with full auditability.
