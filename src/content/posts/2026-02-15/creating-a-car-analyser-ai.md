A developer is building an AI car analyser that uses the UK government's free vehicle inspection API to retrieve MOT history and car details by licence plate, then feeds the data to an AI model for digestible analysis. The goal is to help non-expert car buyers understand vehicle condition and history without endless scrolling through raw inspection reports. It's the first entry in a series exploring architectural ideas for building practical AI tools around open government data.
