Cron Translator v2.0 expands to 16 languages (covering 5 billion users) including German, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and markets like Turkish, Indonesian, and Vietnamese where no competing cron tool previously existed. Spring Boot developers now get instant human-readable translations of `@Scheduled` macros like `@hourly` and `@weekly` across all 16 languages. A new paste-and-parse crontab mode lets you drop in an entire crontab file and get every expression translated at once.
