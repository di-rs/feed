Modern CSS has evolved far beyond styling, now absorbing tasks once exclusive to JavaScript — Grid and Flexbox for complex layouts, hardware-accelerated animations, Custom Properties for brand consistency, and new features like `:has()`, container queries, and built-in math functions. CSS-managed animations leverage GPU acceleration for seamless performance without any JS overhead, while variables enable consistent design systems at scale. Before reaching for another JS library, a well-crafted line of modern CSS might already solve the problem more efficiently.
