A beginner Python tutorial covering three fundamental data structures: dictionaries (mutable ordered key:value collections), sets (unordered collections that discard duplicates), and hashing (converting keys to fixed integer values for O(1) data retrieval). The article includes practical code examples like using a set-based approach to count element frequency in a list and demonstrates how Python's built-in hash() function works. Understanding hash collisions — when two different keys produce the same hash — and resolution strategies like open addressing is essential for technical interviews and writing efficient Python.
