DevFlow is a developer workflow intelligence engine that analyzes Git activity, commit behavior, and command usage to surface actionable insights about how developers actually work — file risk intelligence, late-night coding patterns, bus factor risks, and terminal productivity signals. It runs entirely locally with zero cloud services and provides a live dashboard with real analytics. Built with GitHub Copilot CLI as part of the Copilot CLI Challenge.
