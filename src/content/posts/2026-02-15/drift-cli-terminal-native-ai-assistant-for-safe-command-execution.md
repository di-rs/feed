Drift CLI is a terminal-native AI assistant powered by local LLMs via Ollama that translates natural language into safe, executable shell commands — no cloud dependency, full privacy. It features automatic risk scoring (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), dry-run defaults, confirmation prompts, and 18+ slash commands like /commit, /test, and /git with contextual awareness. A Plan → Preview → Confirm → Execute → Explain → Undo workflow keeps every command run recoverable.
