A GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge submission that addresses the universal developer nightmare of running a destructive command copied from the internet and immediately regretting it. The project adds an "undo button" to the terminal experience — a safety layer that intercepts risky commands, explains what they do, and allows reversal before irreversible damage occurs. Built for an era where developers copy and paste commands faster than they think about the consequences.
