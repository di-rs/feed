A developer used GitHub Copilot CLI to build a Python project analyzing Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) data, exploring which countries produce the highest-rated coffees and how origin affects attributes like sweetness and acidity. The project demonstrates how Copilot CLI can accelerate data exploration tasks, answering fun questions about coffee quality through visualizations and radar charts. It's a practical showcase of AI-assisted data science with minimal manual prompting.
