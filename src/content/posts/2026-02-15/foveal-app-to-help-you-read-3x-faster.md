Foveal is a speed reading app using RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) that flashes words one at a time at a fixed focal point, supporting speeds from 100–1000 WPM with ORP highlighting, context mode, and file import. Built with Next.js, React 19, TypeScript, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS as a GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge submission. The app is fully private with no server-side storage — just visit foveal.app and start reading.
