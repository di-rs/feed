HN Reader is a WinUI 3 desktop app that uses GitHub Copilot CLI as its entire AI backbone to deliver a personalized Hacker News digest and story insights — no LLM API keys required. It fetches 50 popular HN stories, stores them in a knowledge vault, and uses a Copilot CLI agent to generate interest-grouped summaries and structured story breakdowns. Anyone with Copilot CLI installed gets the AI features out of the box.
