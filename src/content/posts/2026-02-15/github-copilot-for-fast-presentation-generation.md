A developer built a workflow using GitHub Copilot CLI and Slidev to generate complete technical slide decks from rough notes in minutes, born from a real situation needing slides in under an hour. The key insight is treating presentations as deterministic code artifacts — providing Copilot with a strict template and minimal high-signal instructions dramatically reduces iteration time. The result is a fast, reproducible way to draft technical presentations without starting from a blank slate.
