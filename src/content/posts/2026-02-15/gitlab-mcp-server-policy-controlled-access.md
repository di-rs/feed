gitlab-mcp is a production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for GitLab that exposes 80+ tools enabling AI assistants to read and manage GitLab projects, merge requests, issues, pipelines, wikis, releases, and more. It features multiple transport options (stdio, Streamable HTTP, SSE), flexible authentication methods, and a built-in policy engine with read-only mode, tool allowlists/denylists, and project-scoped restrictions for safe, controlled AI access.
