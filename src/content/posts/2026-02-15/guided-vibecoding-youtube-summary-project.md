A developer built a YouTube channel summarization dashboard where most code was written by Claude Opus with guidance on architecture and review — a workflow the author calls "guided vibecoding." The app automatically summarizes curated YouTube channels on a schedule, replacing the manual process of finding and individually summarizing long videos via AI chat. The responsive web dashboard with an admin panel demonstrates how human-directed AI authorship can replace a daily hour of manual content consumption with a one-time setup investment.
