As codebases grow beyond any single engineer's comprehension and AI-generated code becomes the norm, chasing perfect architecture or 100% test coverage is a losing strategy — practical heuristics are what actually get systems shipped. This article compiles engineering shortcuts like A* search for pathfinding, greedy algorithms for resource scaling (the same logic that drives Kubernetes HPA), and system design principles that experienced architects internalize as intuition. The goal: arrive at "good enough" decisions in seconds rather than spending weeks on mathematically optimal solutions that never ship.
