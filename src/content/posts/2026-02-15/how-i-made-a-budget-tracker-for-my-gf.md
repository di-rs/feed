A French developer built Spendly, a mobile-friendly budget tracker web app, after his girlfriend found Google Sheets too clunky for personal finance management — no auto-stats, poor mobile UX, and way too many unused features. Built using GitHub Copilot CLI (a submission for the Copilot Challenge), it reuses a codebase from a previous project and adds Google Auth, per-month stats, and responsive design. The live demo is available at spendly.edm115.dev.
