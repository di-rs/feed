A developer rebuilt a complete sports analytics platform backend in Laravel in roughly 2 hours using Claude Code's multi-agent orchestration — delivering auth, CRUD, real-time WebSockets, and chat before midnight.

This showcases how AI orchestration can dramatically compress complex backend development timelines.
