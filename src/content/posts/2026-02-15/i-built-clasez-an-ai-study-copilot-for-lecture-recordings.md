Clasez is a free AI-powered CLI tool built with the GitHub Copilot SDK that transforms lecture transcripts into structured summaries, key concepts, takeaways, and timestamped searchable answers. A student built it to avoid scrubbing through hours of recordings before exams, leveraging Copilot Pro access from the GitHub Student Developer Pack. It fills the gap left by paid transcript tools that limit uploads or hide features behind subscriptions.
