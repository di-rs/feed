MEVA is a lightweight (<15MB) native desktop Markdown reader built with Tauri/Rust, designed specifically for reading AI-generated docs in real time as they stream to a file — with debounced file-watching that reflects changes in milliseconds. It renders LaTeX, Mermaid diagrams, and syntax-highlighted code blocks natively with zero accounts, no cloud sync, and no tracking. Built as a pure reader (no editor, no toolbar), it's the lean alternative to VS Code's split-pane preview that actually does one thing well.
