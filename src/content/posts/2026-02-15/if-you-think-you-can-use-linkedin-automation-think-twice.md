LinkedIn doesn't just detect automation via behavioral patterns like too many invites — it probes your browser environment, including a list of 6,153 Chrome extension IDs, to fingerprint your tool stack. If you have automation helpers, scrapers, or AI comment generators installed, your profile gets scored and silently throttled: lower reach, tighter rate limits, and delayed actions that feel like shadowbanning. The enforcement model is graduated, not binary, meaning accounts are silently degraded rather than outright banned.
