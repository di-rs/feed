Jurnal is a React Native journaling app that records a voice note, transcribes it locally on-device using a Whisper model (privacy-first), then sends the transcript to an online LLM to structure it into a clean journal entry with summary, highlights, and intentions. Built with Expo, react-native-executorch for local inference, and TanStack AI for online LLM calls, the app combines offline transcription with cloud-assisted writing assistance.
