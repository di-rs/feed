A team improved flow efficiency from 32% to 85% by rethinking how they gave AI coding assistants context — discovering that AI shifts the bottleneck from writing code to precisely defining requirements. The author introduces "KAIzen," an AI-era evolution of Agile inspired by Amazon's AI-DLC but designed to layer onto existing Scrum processes mid-sprint rather than replace them wholesale. The framework uses "Blueprint" and "Runbook" artifacts to give AI the structured, unambiguous inputs it needs to generate correct code on the first attempt.
