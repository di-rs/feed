A beginner-friendly tutorial showing how to integrate the OpenAI ChatGPT API into a live chat app using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks) with AJAX for async requests. You get an API key from the OpenAI developer portal, wire up a chat bubble UI using W3Schools templates, and call the API in under 15 minutes total. It's a great starting point for developers who want to explore AI-powered interfaces without the overhead of React or other frameworks.
