A developer manually built a Node.js CLI task manager for the GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge after exhausting the free Copilot quota, supporting add/list/done/delete operations with tasks stored in a local JSON file. Despite not using AI code generation, the project demonstrates independent problem-solving and the ability to ship a functional CLI tool under constraints. The submission is fully tested in PowerShell and available on GitHub, showing that practical developer skills matter even when the AI tooling isn't available.
