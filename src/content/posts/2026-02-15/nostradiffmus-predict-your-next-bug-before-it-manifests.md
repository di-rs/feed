Nostradiffmus is an npm CLI tool that reads your `git diff` and uses GitHub Copilot to predict likely bug categories before you push — covering async race conditions, abandoned error paths, state mutation side effects, and more. It delivers both a dramatically styled "prophecy" (in five tones: tragic, cryptic, sarcastic, biblical, or clinical) and actionable technical advice with confidence scores. Run `nostradiffmus --staged` for a pre-push sanity check, or `--json` for CI pipeline integration.
