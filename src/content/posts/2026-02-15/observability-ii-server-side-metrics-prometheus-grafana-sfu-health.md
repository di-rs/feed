While client-side WebRTC metrics describe symptoms of quality degradation, server-side observability with Prometheus and Grafana reveals root causes — CPU saturation, NACK storms, or network issues at the SFU layer.

Metrics are prioritized over logs in real-time systems because they're aggregatable, cheap to store, and queryable over time.
