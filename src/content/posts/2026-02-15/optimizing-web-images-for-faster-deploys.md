This article covers web asset optimization strategies for faster deploys and better user experience, comparing modern image formats including JPEG, PNG, WebP, and the newer AVIF. WebP delivers superior compression over JPEG/PNG with both lossy and lossless modes and broad modern browser support, while AVIF pushes compression further with growing ecosystem adoption. Choosing the right image format alongside appropriate compression settings is one of the highest-impact performance optimizations available to web developers.
