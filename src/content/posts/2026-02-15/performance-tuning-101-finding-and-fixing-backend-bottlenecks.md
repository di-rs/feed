A practical guide to diagnosing and fixing backend performance bottlenecks, categorized into three areas: backend service optimization, database optimization, and infrastructure tuning. The approach starts with load testing and observability (CPU/memory metrics, logs) to quickly narrow down the root cause before coding a fix. An emergency vertical scaling tip is included for immediate production relief while a proper solution is being developed.
