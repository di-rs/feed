LLMs are excellent at mechanical, pattern-based work — CRUD scaffolding, DTO generation, boilerplate — and this is compressing demand for developers who only do that. The argument is that engineers who survive this shift are those who provide structural thinking, system design, and business domain expertise that LLMs can't replicate. This has happened before with frameworks, ORMs, and CI/CD; AI is just another compression tool, and structural thinkers have always come out on top.
