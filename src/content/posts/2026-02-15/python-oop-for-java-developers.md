A step-by-step translation guide showing Java developers how to rewrite OOP concepts in Python — covering constructors (`__init__`), the absence of method overloading (use `@classmethod` instead), Python's convention-based encapsulation with underscores, and the explicit `self` argument. Unlike Java's enforced visibility modifiers, Python relies on convention, and class inheritance syntax differs (`class Square(Shape)` vs. `extends`). This is a practical bridge article for Java devs picking up Python for the first time.
