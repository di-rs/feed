Redacta is a tool that transforms raw, messy video/audio transcripts into well-structured, properly punctuated documents using GitHub Copilot and LLMs — solving the pain of unreadable auto-generated captions. Beyond redaction, it enriches text with relevant images and diagrams, generates summaries, and translates content into other languages. It also features a real-time terminal UI built with Ink and supports batch processing of entire transcript directories.
