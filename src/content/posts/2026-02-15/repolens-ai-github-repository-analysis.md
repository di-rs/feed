RepoLens AI is a web app that analyzes any public GitHub repository via URL and generates a comprehensive technical report with architecture summaries, full-stack breakdowns, strengths/weaknesses, and beginner-friendly task suggestions — all powered by Google Gemini. What stands out are five unique zero-dependency SVG visualizations: an animated language ring, health radar chart, interactive architecture node graph, Myers-Briggs-style repo personality analysis, and an atmospheric hero orb. Built with React 19, Vite 7, TailwindCSS v4, and Express 5 as a GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge submission.
