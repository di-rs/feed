The author argues that the "10x developer" myth misunderstands what makes senior engineers valuable — it's not output volume but the ability to avoid unnecessary work entirely, like a cache layer. Through a real-world story of a senior who solved a CPU-spiking scaling crisis by deleting a single O(n²) for-loop — dropping CPU usage 70% with no architecture changes — the piece reframes seniority as optimizing for absence of complexity, latency, and failure modes rather than feature throughput.
