Google search operators like `site:`, `intitle:`, `filetype:`, and `before:`/`after:` let developers and SEOs filter results with surgical precision — finding indexed pages, competitor content, or downloadable resources instantly. Most people don't use them because the syntax is hard to memorize, so the author built a free query generator at flexitoolbox.com that lets you fill in fields and copy the final query. Mastering these operators can save hours per week for anyone doing web research or SEO auditing.
