Modern Java has been steadily reducing its verbosity through a series of JEPs across versions 21–25, including unnamed classes, implicitly declared classes, and instance main methods — so beginners can now write a working program without first understanding access modifiers, static, or class declarations. These improvements are part of an explicit OpenJDK goal to let students write their first programs without needing to understand features designed for large-scale enterprise codebases. Java's reputation for verbosity is increasingly out of date.
