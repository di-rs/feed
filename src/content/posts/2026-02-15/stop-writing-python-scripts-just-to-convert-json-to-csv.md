Instead of writing a one-off Python converter every time a PM asks for JSON data in a spreadsheet, the author built PaPiv — a free browser-based JSON-to-CSV converter that processes everything locally without sending data to any server. The tool handles nested objects and generates downloadable `.csv` files in seconds, addressing both the time cost (15-20 min script setup) and the security risk of using online converters that upload sensitive data to their backends.
