A developer built a stutter-friendly speaking practice app focused on providing calm, supportive, and judgment-free feedback for people who stutter. Built with Elm, Elixir, and GitHub Copilot CLI, the app centers on gentle feedback mechanisms and a privacy-first design philosophy. The project is as much about the mission of reducing speaking anxiety as it is about the technical stack.
