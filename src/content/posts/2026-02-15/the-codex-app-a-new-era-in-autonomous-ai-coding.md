OpenAI's Codex app marks a fundamental shift from reactive AI code suggestions to autonomous AI execution — agents can analyze entire repos, decompose high-level requirements into tasks, implement changes across multiple files, and run validation suites. Unlike traditional assistants that respond to micro-prompts, Codex introduces structured task delegation where developers assign objectives and supervise results. Multi-agent orchestration enables parallel workstreams, changing the interaction model from prompt→response to assign→supervise→review.
