A learning journal entry documenting progress through Linux admin modules: source code installation (building/installing from source), Yum OS/kernel patching with rollback capabilities, and LVM snapshots for backup and recovery. Six modules completed in a single day with the AlNafi online learning platform, covering hands-on skills that are directly applicable to RHCSA certification preparation.
