This deep dive into transformer architecture focuses on the Encoder component from the landmark "Attention Is All You Need" paper, exploring how self-attention mechanisms replace RNNs for handling long-range dependencies in sequences. The article builds an intuitive understanding of why the Encoder works — framing attention as a "search warrant" that retrieves relevant context across an entire sequence simultaneously rather than processing it sequentially. Part 1 of a multi-part series.
