Visual Agentic Dev is an open-source browser development environment that lets developers click any React component on a live page to instantly locate its source code and trigger AI-powered edits — all without leaving the browser. It uses React Fiber for zero-config source location, supports multi-project parallel development, and integrates with agents like Claude Code, featuring batch element modification and built-in terminal integration. The project aims to make AI agents a genuinely integrated part of the development lifecycle rather than a separate chat interface.
