Co Designer is a Chrome extension that turns your browser into a visual CSS editor — select any element, tweak fonts, colors, layout, and shadows visually, then hit "Generate" to get a ready-to-paste GitHub Copilot CLI prompt from your changes. Built for the GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge, it bridges visual design and AI-assisted coding workflows without any manual CSS hunting. Install it by loading the unpacked extension from the GitHub repo directly into Chrome's developer mode.
