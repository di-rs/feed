After two years of AI-assisted development, the author identified a consistent pattern: every AI model has its own characteristic failure modes that it can't reliably self-catch. Inspired by the pair programming practice from Extreme Programming, they built a dual-agent workflow where one agent writes code and another independently reviews it — the same principle as human code review but with AI agents. The approach proved effective enough that a PR written entirely by the two agents was merged into a 15k-star open-source Electron project.
