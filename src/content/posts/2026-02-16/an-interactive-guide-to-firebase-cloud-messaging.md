Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is Google's free cross-platform service for sending push notifications and data payloads to Android, iOS, and web apps without dealing with platform-specific complexities like APNs or Google Play Services. This interactive guide covers FCM's core architecture (routing messages from your server through Google's backend to devices), two main message types (notification vs. data), practical setup, and advanced tips for real-world use cases like chat app notifications. FCM is essential for boosting user retention with timely, reliable alerts.
