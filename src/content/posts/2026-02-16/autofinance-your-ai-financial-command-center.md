AutoFinance is a terminal-based financial research tool built with 13 specialized MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, each handling a distinct domain — real-time market data via Yahoo Finance and Binance, risk validation, RSI/MACD technical analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and more. It integrates GitHub Copilot CLI for natural-language portfolio queries and pushes critical alerts to Slack, Discord, SMS, and email. A compelling example of composing MCP microservices into a professional-grade developer tool.
