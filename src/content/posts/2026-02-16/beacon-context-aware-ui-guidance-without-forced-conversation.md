Beacon is a browser extension that helps users navigate complex web pages by observing page structure, extracting interactive elements, and visually highlighting the most relevant ones with contextual tooltips — no chatbot required. Rather than forcing a conversational AI workflow, Beacon orients users directly on the page by highlighting UI elements in response to natural queries like "where do I edit my profile?" It represents a shift toward non-conversational AI that guides rather than interrupts.
