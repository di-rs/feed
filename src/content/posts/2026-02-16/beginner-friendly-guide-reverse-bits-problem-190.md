A beginner-friendly walkthrough of LeetCode Problem 190 — reversing the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer — explaining the core bit manipulation technique of iterating over all 32 positions, checking each bit with a right-shift and AND operation, then placing it at its mirrored position using OR and left-shift. Solutions are provided in C++, Python, and JavaScript with step-by-step intuition using a simplified 4-bit example to illustrate the logic. A solid introduction to binary manipulation fundamentals.
