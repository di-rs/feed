BioSecure CLI is a Python terminal tool built in 32 minutes using GitHub Copilot Agents, tackling three Nigerian primary healthcare failures: patient phone number validation, BMI-based triage with hypertensive crisis detection, and vaccine inventory tracking with low-stock alerts. The project showcases how AI agents can autonomously scaffold an entire project structure, install dependencies, and generate complex logic with tests simultaneously — without a single manual `mkdir`.
