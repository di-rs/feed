Wisepanel brings ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity together in distinct analytical roles — one focused on risk, another on opportunity, another on alternatives, another on evidence — so they deliberate rather than just answer the same prompt in parallel. The real value emerges from inter-model interaction: when one model's risk flag changes another's evidence assessment, you surface tradeoffs none would catch alone.
