Unravel is an educational tool built to demystify Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by visualizing every step of the pipeline in real time, from document parsing to embedding space to retrieval results. The author built it after struggling to understand RAG tradeoffs — chunk size, overlap, embedding models, BM25 vs dense retrieval — without being able to see what was actually happening inside the black box. By visualizing each decision, Unravel makes it easy to compare strategies and understand their impact on accuracy and speed.
