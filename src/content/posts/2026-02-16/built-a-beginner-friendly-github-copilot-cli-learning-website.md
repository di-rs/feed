CopilotCLI is a beginner-friendly educational website built with plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript and deployed on Vercel that walks developers through GitHub Copilot CLI step-by-step — covering installation, essential commands, best practices, and interactive FAQs. Built for the GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge without any frameworks or external dependencies, keeping it fast and lightweight. The goal is making AI-powered terminal workflows accessible to newcomers who find official documentation too dense to start with.
