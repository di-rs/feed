Nuxt is more than a Vue meta-framework — it's a strategic business choice that reduces risk through hosting-agnostic deployment (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Docker, and more), a rich enterprise module ecosystem (Storyblok, Stripe, Supabase), and built-in SSR/SSG/hybrid rendering for SEO and performance. The article highlights how Nuxt's flexibility eliminates vendor lock-in and accelerates time-to-market, making it attractive not just to developers but to CTOs and product teams. Features like `@nuxtjs/seo`, `@nuxt/a11y`, and script/font optimization modules further strengthen its case for production applications.
