DocWeave is a CLI tool that analyzes git repositories and generates organized documentation using GitHub Copilot CLI, including Mermaid diagrams (timelines, file relationships) and AI-powered insights. It solves "documentation debt" — where code evolves faster than docs — by transforming commit history into structured markdown automatically. Just run `docweave analyze` in any git repo to get started.
