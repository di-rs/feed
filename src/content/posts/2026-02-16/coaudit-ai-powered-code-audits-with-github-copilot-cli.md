coaudit is a CLI tool that uses GitHub Copilot to perform structured code audits across six dimensions: dead code, architectural leaks, selector fragility, routing inconsistencies, missing tests, and observability gaps. It works on local repos or GitHub URLs, chunks code intelligently within token limits, and generates a structured Markdown report — providing semantic analysis that traditional static analyzers can't match. The tool supports multi-language codebases including JS, TS, Python, PHP, Go, Java, and Rust.
