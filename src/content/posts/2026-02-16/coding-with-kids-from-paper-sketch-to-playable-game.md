A developer describes how they use paper sketches and Google AI Studio to help children aged 8–10 design and build playable tablet games — letting kids lead the design, then using AI to translate messy drawings into structured game rules. The result is two real open-source games (Minecraft and Hogwarts themes) born from crooked A4 sketches. The process mirrors real product iteration, teaching kids structured thinking through the medium they love most.
