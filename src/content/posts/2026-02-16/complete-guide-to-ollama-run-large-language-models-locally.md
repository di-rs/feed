Ollama is an open-source tool that lets you run large language models like Llama, Mistral, and CodeLlama entirely on your own machine — no internet required after setup, no API costs, and full data privacy. Think of it as Docker for AI models, packaging everything needed for local inference into easy-to-use containers. This guide covers installation on macOS, Linux, and Windows through to building production-ready AI-powered applications.
