A pure CSS/HTML coding challenge to create a seamlessly looping infinite scroll animation with zero JavaScript—using only @keyframes and CSS transforms. The classic technique involves duplicating content and applying a translateX(-50%) or translateY(-50%) offset to hide the seam where the loop restarts. Bonus points are awarded for hover-based speed changes and multi-layer parallax effects at varying speeds.
