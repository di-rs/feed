DEALZ is a GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge submission — a mobile app that lets users capture local business deals via photo, using OCR/AI to auto-parse deal details and display them on an interactive map. Users can save, filter, and browse public or private deals, and bookmark favorites to a personal "My Deals" list. GitHub Copilot CLI dramatically accelerated development, helping ship 6 features in a single day and reducing a multi-week build to days.
