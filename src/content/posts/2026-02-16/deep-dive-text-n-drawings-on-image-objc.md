This MIT-licensed iOS project written entirely in Objective-C serves as a functional image editor and time capsule for classic iOS development techniques. It features a custom AVFoundation camera (bypassing standard iOS UI), GPUImage filters for Instagram-style color grading, CoreText rendering for high-quality typography overlays, and freehand drawing capabilities. The repository is a valuable learning resource for AVCaptureSession management, UIImagePickerController integration, and vintage iOS UI patterns.
