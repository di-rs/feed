DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) is the model where distributed communities — rather than corporations — build and own real-world hardware networks, earning token rewards for contributing hotspots, dashcams, GPUs, or storage. Projects like Helium (wireless), Hivemapper (maps), and Render (GPU compute) illustrate how blockchain settles contributions and payments transparently, creating community-owned alternatives to telecom giants and cloud providers.
