A clear explainer on the three standard deployment environments — Dev, Stage, and Production — covering their purpose, who uses them, and how GitOps with Argo CD manages promotion between them. Dev is a playground for testing builds and container health, Stage mirrors production for QA and integration testing, and Production requires explicit approval strategies to protect real users. The article emphasizes why direct-to-production deploys are dangerous and how separate Argo CD applications per environment enforce safe, controlled releases.
