A TypeScript command-line tool for logging and visualizing blood sugar and insulin data, built as a GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge submission. The tool stores readings locally and renders terminal-based charts for tracking trends over time. It demonstrates how GitHub Copilot CLI can accelerate exploration of alternative implementations and fast iteration on a niche but genuinely useful health utility.
