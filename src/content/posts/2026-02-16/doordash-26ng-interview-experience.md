A recent DoorDash 2026 new grad candidate shares a detailed breakdown of all four interview rounds covering BFS-based grid traversal, dasher dispatch optimization, real-time GPS tracking with WebSockets and Redis, and order idempotency design. The rounds closely mirror DoorDash's real engineering systems, with the interviewer confirming that greedy assignment and zone-based matching align with their actual dispatch logic. Strong candidates combine 200+ LeetCode problems with the ability to connect technical solutions to business outcomes.
