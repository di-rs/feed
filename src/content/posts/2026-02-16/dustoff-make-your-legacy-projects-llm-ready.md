DustOff is a tool that migrates legacy side projects into a modern Next.js + TypeScript stack, making them ready for AI-assisted development. Built using GitHub Copilot CLI, it removes the friction of restarting abandoned projects by standardizing structure and preparing code for today's tooling. The live demo is available at dust-off.vercel.app.
