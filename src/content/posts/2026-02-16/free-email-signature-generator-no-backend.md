SigCraft is a fully client-side email signature generator built without any backend — photos are base64-encoded in the browser, preview renders in real-time, and zero network requests are made after page load, keeping your personal data private. The author shares hard-won lessons about email client compatibility: forget modern CSS, because in 2026 we're still writing table-based layouts for Outlook and stripping style tags for Gmail. Ships with 6 templates and outputs both rich text and raw HTML.
