A concise step-by-step guide to generating an Ed25519 SSH key without a passphrase, copying it to a remote server with `ssh-copy-id`, and setting up SSH client config aliases for fast server access. Also covers fixing common permission issues (chmod 700/600/644) that cause SSH to silently reject keys.
