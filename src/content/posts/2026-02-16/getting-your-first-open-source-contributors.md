Saying "contributions welcome" in your README isn't enough to attract contributors — projects need complete setup instructions, visible recent activity (at least monthly commits), and specific labeled issues to guide newcomers. Reducing friction at every step matters: if a potential contributor can't get your project running locally, they won't contribute.
