Hive is a terminal-native multi-agent orchestration tool built on the GitHub Copilot SDK that coordinates a swarm of specialized AI agents — Scouts, Architects, Builders, Guardians, and Runners — working in parallel via a DAG to solve complex development tasks. It features a rich TUI for real-time visualization, voice-driven control, a self-healing auto-fix loop, GitHub Issue autopilot, and session recording in asciinema format. Instead of chatting with AI, users delegate entire workflows in natural language and let the Hivemind decompose and execute them.
