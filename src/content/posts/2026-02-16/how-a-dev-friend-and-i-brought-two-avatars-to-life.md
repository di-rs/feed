A developer from India and one from Japan teamed up on DEV Community to build a 3D avatar interaction project, starting with simple placeholder shapes and working up to animated characters. Using VRoid Studio for avatar creation and iterating across time zones in short windows, they transformed static T-posed models into a live, interactive two-character scene. The result is a cross-border open collaboration that highlights how small pockets of async work can quietly accumulate into something real.
