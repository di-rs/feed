Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code, ships 50–100 PRs per week by running ~10 Claude sessions in parallel and using system notifications to manage when human input is needed. He exclusively uses Claude Opus 4.5 with thinking enabled—slower per token but faster overall due to less course-correcting—and relies on a shared 2,500-token CLAUDE.md file checked into their Git repo. The key insight is treating AI assistance as parallelizable rather than sequential, effectively multiplying development capacity.
