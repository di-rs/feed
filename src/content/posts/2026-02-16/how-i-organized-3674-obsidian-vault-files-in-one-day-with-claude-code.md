A developer used Claude Code (Opus 4.6) to organize 3,674 Markdown files exported from Evernote, Apple Notes, and Apple Journal into a clean Obsidian vault in a single day. The process involved bulk frontmatter insertion via Python scripts, duplicate detection and removal (eliminating 2,751 duplicates), folder-to-tag mapping across 26 folders, and batch JSON configuration of 10 plugins. Claude Code excelled at the task because it could combine rule-based processing with per-file content judgment at scale.
