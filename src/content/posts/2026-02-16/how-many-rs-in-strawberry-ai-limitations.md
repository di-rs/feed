A thoughtful pushback on the recurring pattern of fixating on AI's edge-case failures—counting letters in "strawberry," rendering wine glasses, generating six-fingered hands—as evidence the technology is fundamentally broken. The author argues that critics always anchor to the current ceiling and miss the broader trajectory: models have repeatedly blown past their previous limitations while the goalposts simply shift. Understanding why these glitches exist (tokenization, architecture constraints) matters more for builders than the meme-worthy failures themselves.
