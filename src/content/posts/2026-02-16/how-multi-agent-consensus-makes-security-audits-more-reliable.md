Single-agent security scanning inherits the biases and blind spots of a single tool — false positives, false negatives, and model-specific gaps. AgentAudit's multi-agent consensus model runs multiple independent AI agents to audit the same package separately, then cross-validates findings with a quorum of at least 5 reviewers before anything is published. This approach borrows from distributed systems principles and academic peer review to produce more reliable, hallucination-resistant security assessments.
