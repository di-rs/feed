This reflective piece traces the full abstraction stack from front panel switches to modern printf, observing that every generation of programmers has built on layers they didn't write — and that was always fine. What's genuinely new with AI-generated code isn't the abstraction itself, but that for the first time you can get output without going through the thinking that used to produce it; the key question becomes whether you'd know when the output looks right but isn't.
