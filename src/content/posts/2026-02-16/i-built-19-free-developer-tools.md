Frustrated with ad-riddled, popup-heavy online tools, the author built JSON Knife—a collection of 19 free developer utilities including JSON formatter/validator/diff, JSON↔YAML/CSV/TOML converters, regex tester, SQL formatter, JWT decoder, cron generator, and more. Everything runs entirely in the browser with zero server calls and no analytics, built as a static SvelteKit app on Cloudflare Pages using Svelte 5's new runes reactivity system. Available at tools.shanecode.org with no ads, no signup, and no tracking.
