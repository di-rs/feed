Adola is a lightweight Telegram accountability bot — you set a goal and a daily check-in time, and it messages you every day for a quick update, with near-zero friction since it lives where you already chat. Built with Node.js + Fastify for webhooks, isolated agent containers per user for conversation memory, and PostgreSQL for scheduling. Try it at @adola2048_bot on Telegram.
