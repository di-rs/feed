Amerta is an MIT-licensed open-source e-commerce platform built on Next.js 16 and PayloadCMS 3.7, offering a third path between Shopify's SaaS fees and WooCommerce's plugin hell. Its Local API architecture eliminates HTTP overhead between frontend and CMS by querying the database directly via function calls, targeting developers who want full ownership with zero transaction fees.
