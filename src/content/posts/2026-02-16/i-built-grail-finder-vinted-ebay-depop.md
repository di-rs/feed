GrailSearch is a unified search engine for secondhand fashion that fans out queries to eBay, Vinted, Depop, Grailed, Vestiaire Collective, and Poshmark simultaneously, eliminating the need to search each platform separately. eBay uses the official Browse API while Vinted required reverse-engineering their internal endpoints—no public API available. The tool addresses the $200B+ resale market's fragmentation problem where the best deal might be on one platform while buyers are stuck searching another.
