Locked In is a Chrome extension that combats mindless social media scrolling by asking users to define their intention before entering distracting websites — setting a goal and optional time limit before accessing sites like YouTube or LinkedIn. A floating widget then keeps the stated goal visible while browsing, holding users accountable without outright blocking sites. Built by someone with ADHD who needed a practical focus tool for daily social media work tasks.
