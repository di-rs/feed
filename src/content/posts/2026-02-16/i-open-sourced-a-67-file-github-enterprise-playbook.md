A developer released a 67-file GitHub Enterprise learning guide on GitHub, drawing from real-world onboarding and enablement work at NRI Oxalis. The resource is currently Japanese-first but English coverage is planned, and community contributions via PRs and Discussions are welcome. It's hosted as a GitHub Page and serves as a practical reference for teams adopting GitHub at scale.
