A developer recreated OpenClaw from scratch using Claude Agent SDK, building a 24/7 AI gateway system with integrations for WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and iMessage while addressing security vulnerabilities in the original. The project demonstrates how modern coding agent SDKs (Claude, OpenCode) can bootstrap complex multi-platform AI systems, with the result published as open-source at ComposioHQ/secure-openclaw.
