Tailgrids 3.0 launches as a structured React component library built on Tailwind CSS, offering 600+ components (100+ free, 500+ Pro), 8+ templates, and a Figma design system with 2,800+ components and variants. It targets product teams who want reusable components with scalable design tokens — positioned as an alternative to Shadcn UI, Material UI, and Chakra UI.
