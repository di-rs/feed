IPv4 is the 32-bit addressing protocol that underpins global internet traffic, assigning unique identifiers (e.g. 192.168.0.1) to devices via DHCP or static configuration. The article breaks down public vs. private IP ranges, how NAT enables private networks to reach the internet, and why the ~4.3 billion address space is nearly exhausted — making IPv6 increasingly necessary. A solid primer for anyone getting into networking fundamentals.
