Katiba is a free, gamified mobile app built with Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform that makes Kenya's 2010 Constitution accessible and engaging for all citizens, inspired by civic educator Ng'ang'a Muigai. It features Spring physics animations, Material Design 3, type-safe Navigation 3, and Kotlin Coroutines to deliver a polished cross-platform Android/iOS learning experience without purchasing physical copies.
