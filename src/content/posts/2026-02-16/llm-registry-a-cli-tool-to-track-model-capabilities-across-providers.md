LLM Registry is a Python package and CLI tool that tracks metadata — pricing, features, context windows, API parameters — for 140+ models across 16 providers in one place. It eliminates the need to dig through multiple provider docs by providing a unified interface via a Python API or the `llmr` CLI tool. Available on PyPI as `pip install llm-registry`.
