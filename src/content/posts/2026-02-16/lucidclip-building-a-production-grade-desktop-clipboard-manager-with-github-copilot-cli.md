LucidClip is a privacy-first macOS clipboard manager built with a local-first architecture, featuring instant search, retrieval, and clean separation between UI, domain, and persistence layers. The author used GitHub Copilot CLI as a "terminal-native pair engineer" to compress iteration loops across exploration, debugging, and documentation during development. It demonstrates how AI-assisted CLI tools can accelerate shipping production-grade desktop software without sacrificing architectural discipline.
