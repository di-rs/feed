Adrian Vanzyl argues that machine learning projects fail when teams reach for complex architectures before defining the actual decision they need to make. Establishing clear, measurable objectives upfront consistently outperforms sophisticated models built on vague goals. The core principle: define the decision first, then choose the simplest algorithm that solves it.
