A hands-on guide to automating developer activity on the Monad Testnet using Web3.py, covering RPC auto-selection, token wrapping/unwrapping, contract deployment, and NFT minting. The tutorial introduces a "Monad Swiss Knife" Python tool that automatically finds the fastest available RPC endpoint to avoid timeouts. The open-source project helps developers and airdrop farmers maintain consistent wallet activity on the testnet without manual interaction.
