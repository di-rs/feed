Merge Resolver is an AI-powered CLI tool built for the GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge that automatically resolves Git merge conflicts by sending conflicting code blocks to Copilot for smart resolution. It features safe file backups before modifications, a preview mode to review AI suggestions before committing, and cross-platform support across Linux, macOS, and Windows. The tool aims to reduce the tedious manual effort of conflict resolution while keeping developers in full control.
