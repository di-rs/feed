Claude Session Tools is a free VSCode extension that lets you monitor multiple Claude Code sessions in real-time, with notifications when Claude needs attention or a session gets stuck. It solves the problem of losing track of parallel AI coding workflows running simultaneously. Available for free on the VSCode Marketplace.
