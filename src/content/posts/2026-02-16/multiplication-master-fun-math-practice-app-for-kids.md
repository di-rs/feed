Multiplication Master is a web-based math practice app built with GitHub Copilot CLI to help kids improve multiplication skills through interactive exercises, timers, and instant feedback. The developer built it to help their son who struggled with multiplication tables, getting the core functionality done in 10–30 minutes with Copilot's help. It includes a game mode, on-screen keyboard, progress summaries, and future plans for a leaderboard to let kids challenge classmates.
