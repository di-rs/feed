NeuroMode is a cognitive regulation layer built on top of GitHub Copilot CLI that addresses the problem of overwhelming AI responses for developers with ADHD, anxiety, or other focus difficulties. It computes a Cognitive Friction Score (CFS) to estimate task-induced cognitive demand, then automatically activates a progressive decomposition mode that releases only the next minimal executable step. Instead of delivering entire architectures at once, NeuroMode transforms complex tasks into manageable increments, making AI-assisted development more accessible.
