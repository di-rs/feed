Modern AI models demand the parallel computation power of GPUs, and NVIDIA dominates this space through a mature ecosystem combining CUDA, cuDNN, tensor cores, and mixed-precision support that integrates seamlessly with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. As models exceed single-GPU capacity, distributed training techniques like data parallelism become essential, requiring carefully orchestrated multi-GPU infrastructure. The article examines why NVIDIA's hardware-software combination remains the de facto choice for large-scale deep learning in 2026.
