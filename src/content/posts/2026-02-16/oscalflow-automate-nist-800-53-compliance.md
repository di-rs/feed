OSCALFlow is a GitHub CLI extension that scans codebases to auto-detect NIST 800-53 and FedRAMP compliance controls across 8 languages, saving security teams hundreds of manual documentation hours. Tested on a real federal system, it achieved 19.8% auto-detection (48 controls, ~24 hours saved), and uses GitHub Copilot CLI internally to validate implementations and suggest missing controls.
