OxideDock is a comprehensive Tauri v2 + Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 starter template that eliminates the boilerplate of setting up a desktop app from scratch. It comes pre-configured with Vitest, Playwright, ESLint, Prettier, Clippy, GitHub Actions CI for all three platforms, daily security audits, and automated release pipelines that produce .dmg, .deb, .AppImage, .msi, and .exe binaries on tag push. Run `make setup && make dev` and you're immediately writing actual app code.
