The 200th edition of Perl Weekly highlights the growing async ecosystem in Perl, covering modules like IO::Async, Mojolicious async features, and HTTP/2-capable servers like PAGI and Thunderhorse that enable high-throughput web services and streaming pipelines. The issue also covers TPRC 2026 conference announcements in Greenville, SC and Perl Steering Council discussions around legal identifiers. Perl's potential in concurrent programming continues to expand with each new module and project release.
