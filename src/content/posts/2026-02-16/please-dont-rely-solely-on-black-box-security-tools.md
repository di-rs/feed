Enterprise security scanners are valuable but lack agility for real-time, context-aware compliance — a custom Python-based vulnerability engine can bridge that gap by mapping scan results directly to NIST Cybersecurity Framework controls. Using libraries like Nmap and Scapy, developers can build lean, modular security layers that integrate into CI/CD pipelines and enable continuous monitoring rather than point-in-time audits. The key insight is that customization and automation together enable measurable, architectural defense rather than reactive scanning.
