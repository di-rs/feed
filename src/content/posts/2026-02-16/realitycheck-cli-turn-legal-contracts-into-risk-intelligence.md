RealityCheck CLI is a Python tool that ingests contract PDFs and outputs structured risk intelligence — five quantified metrics (Overall Risk Score, Power Imbalance, Ambiguity Index, Protection Coverage, Leverage Index), clause-by-clause classification across 7 legal categories, and negotiation-ready email drafts with specific rewrites. It can also diff two contract versions to catch newly introduced risks between drafts, with optional Google Gemini enrichment for deeper analysis. Built for the GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge, it tackles the real problem of signing contracts you don't fully understand.
