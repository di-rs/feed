A complete guide to the Sliding Window algorithmic technique, which efficiently processes contiguous subarrays or substrings by reusing previous computations instead of recalculating from scratch. The guide covers both fixed and variable window sizes, explaining how sliding the window (removing the leftmost element, adding a new right element) dramatically reduces time complexity for array and string problems.
