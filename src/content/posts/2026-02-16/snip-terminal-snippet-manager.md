snip is a CLI snippet manager that lets developers save, search, and safely execute code snippets from the terminal with fuzzy search, a keyboard-first TUI, and GitHub Gist sync. Built with GitHub Copilot assistance, it uses SQLite for storage (better-sqlite3 with a WASM fallback) and is installable via npm as `snip-manager`.
