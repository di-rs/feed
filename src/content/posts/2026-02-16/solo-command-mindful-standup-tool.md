Solo Command is a web app that brings structured daily standups to solo developers and indie founders — tracking what you did, what's next, and what's blocking you across multiple projects. Built over a weekend with GitHub Copilot CLI, it features idea capture, multi-project tagging, timeline and board views, and a calm intentional design aimed at reducing context-switching chaos.
