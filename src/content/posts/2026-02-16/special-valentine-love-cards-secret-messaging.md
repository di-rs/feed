Valentine Love Heart Cards is a Spring Boot web application that hides secret messages inside valentine card images using LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography, encoding text into pixel RGB channel bits invisible to the naked eye. Users can create cards with hidden messages or decode images to reveal secrets, all served from a single-JAR deployment with no JavaScript frameworks. Built as a GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge submission, the project pivoted from an over-engineered 7-layer architecture to a clean, ship-ready design in hours.
