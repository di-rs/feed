Schema Sentry is a TypeScript library that brings type-safe JSON-LD structured data generation to Next.js, offering full autocomplete, compile-time validation, and zero runtime overhead. It supports both App Router and Pages Router patterns with builders for common schema types like Article, Product, FAQPage, and BreadcrumbList. A CLI tool enables CI/CD validation so broken or missing structured data never ships to production—improving both traditional SEO rich snippets and AI content discoverability.
