Image AI projects typically fail gradually through compounding small mistakes — inconsistent outputs, hidden artifacts, and slow iteration cycles — rather than one dramatic bug. The core anti-pattern is treating generative models like one-off designers instead of building invariant contracts with defined formats, color profiles, and reproducible prompt templates. Teams that treat AI image generation as a deterministic production service rather than a creative toy see far more consistent brand and quality results.
