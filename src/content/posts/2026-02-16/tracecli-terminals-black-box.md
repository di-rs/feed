TraceCLI is a privacy-first productivity monitor that silently tracks your workflow — apps, window titles, CPU usage, and browser history — storing everything locally in SQLite with no cloud sync. It features a GitHub-style heatmap, a Pomodoro focus mode with distraction detection, AI-powered insights via Gemini/OpenAI, and a real-time TUI dashboard built with Rich.
