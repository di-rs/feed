AI agents like Claude Code and GitHub Copilot often produce fragile Playwright tests because they lack context about your specific application—leading to broken selectors and failing CI pipelines. The Playwright Skill is an open-source collection of 70+ curated markdown guides that give AI agents structured, battle-tested reference patterns for auth flows, visual testing, and test scaling. By providing better context upfront, the approach yields production-grade test code instead of tutorial-level output.
