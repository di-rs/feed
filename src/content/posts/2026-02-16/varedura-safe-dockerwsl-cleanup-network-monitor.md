Varedura is a focused toolkit for safely cleaning up Docker/WSL resources and monitoring local network activity, featuring a Textual TUI and CLI tools. It safely prunes Docker containers, images, and volumes; compacts Windows VHDX files for WSL; and provides network speed and port-scan monitoring — all with explicit confirmation required for destructive actions. Built with GitHub Copilot CLI assistance and available on GitHub.
