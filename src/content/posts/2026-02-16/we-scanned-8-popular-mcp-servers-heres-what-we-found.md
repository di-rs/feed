A security review of 8 popular MCP servers — including @playwright/mcp, Anthropic's official filesystem server, and Kubernetes tools — found one real SQL injection vulnerability in a MySQL MCP server where optional parameterization allows raw SQL to execute directly. The analysis also identified excellent security patterns worth copying alongside some concerning gaps. The vulnerable package was reported to its maintainer.
