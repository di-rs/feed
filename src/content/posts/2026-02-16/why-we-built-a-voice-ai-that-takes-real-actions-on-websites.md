AnveVoice is a voice AI agent that goes beyond FAQ-style chatbots by actually manipulating the DOM — navigating pages, filling forms, and clicking buttons based on natural voice commands. Built for Indian SMBs, it supports Hindi-English code-switching and embeds on any website via a single script tag at ₹999/month.
