ZSCI is an AI AWS Infrastructure Agent that analyzes your account's running services, IAM policies, resource relationships, and usage patterns before proposing any changes — never acting silently or blindly. Instead of replacing DevOps engineers, it reduces repetitive analysis tasks like cost optimization reviews and security hardening while requiring explicit approval before executing anything. The tool positions AI as a cognitive load reducer for AWS management, not an autonomous operator.
