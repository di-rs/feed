Causal Machine Learning Engineering is a subset of ML that goes beyond correlation to understand the actual cause-and-effect relationships between variables — instead of just asking "what patterns exist in the data?" it asks "why do things happen?" This is increasingly important in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles, where models must make decisions that hold up under interventions, not just in observed data distributions. The field draws from statistics, econometrics, and philosophy of science to make AI systems more robust and interpretable.
