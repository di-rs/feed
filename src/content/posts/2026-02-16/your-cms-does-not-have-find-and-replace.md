HubSpot CMS still lacks a sitewide find-and-replace feature in 2026, despite a community request open since 2017 — leaving users to manually edit hundreds of pages one by one when rebranding or updating URLs.

The workaround options (custom API scripts, manual edits) are so painful that users regularly switch platforms or write their own tooling.
