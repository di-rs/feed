A practical guide for construction operations managers on using ChatGPT to auto-generate role-specific onboarding checklists, safety SOPs, and welcome messages, combined with TaskTag for real-time task execution on job sites. The approach replaces chaotic paper-based onboarding with a scalable, AI-standardized workflow that gets new hires productive faster with fewer errors. Sample prompts are provided for generating general laborer safety checklists, trade-specific 3-day schedules, and personalized welcome messages.
