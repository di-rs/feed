This beginner C# lesson explains why loops become infinite when state doesn't change—the real goal is understanding that while loops terminate only through state change driven by operators like `+=`, `-=`, and `++`. The post walks through progressively more complex examples using compound assignment operators to show how structural simplifications in loop bodies lead to safer, cleaner code. It's part of a structured C# learning series focused on building deep understanding of control flow fundamentals.
