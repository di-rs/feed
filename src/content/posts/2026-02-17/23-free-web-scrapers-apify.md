An indie developer built and released 23 free web scrapers on the Apify platform covering Amazon, TikTok, Google Maps, LinkedIn, and more — sharing lessons on anti-bot challenges, A/B test detection, and the value of open-source reputation building. Apify's managed infrastructure let the author focus entirely on scraping logic rather than DevOps, making it a compelling platform for building a "Swiss Army Knife" of data extraction tools. The portfolio approach — free tools as marketing — proved effective for establishing credibility in the scraper-as-a-service ecosystem.
