The Elara Protocol is a layered validation architecture designed to work fully offline in under 2ms with zero dependencies — even in interplanetary scenarios with 24-minute signal delays. Built across Python and Rust, it uses post-quantum cryptography (Dilithium3 in 159µs) and Adaptive Witness Consensus that scales from local-only to globally attested. The modular design lets you strip it down to pure validation or stack AI intelligence on top.
