Five advanced JavaScript techniques for moving into senior territory: private state with closures via the Revealing Module Pattern, function currying and composition for functional programming, the Proxy object for meta-programming and validation, memoization for caching expensive computations, and WeakMap for memory-safe caching that avoids DOM element leaks. Each pattern targets real performance, security, or maintainability problems in production code.
