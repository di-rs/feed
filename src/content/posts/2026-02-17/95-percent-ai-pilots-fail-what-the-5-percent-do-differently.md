MIT's NANDA initiative found that only ~5% of enterprise AI pilot programs achieve measurable revenue impact despite $30–40B in generative AI spending, largely because teams shipping agents to production lack visibility into what those agents are actually doing. The key differentiator for successful teams is implementing distributed tracing and observability across multi-step agent chains, so failures can be pinpointed rather than debugged blind. The article examines the debugging black-box problem and what practices the successful 5% consistently adopt.
