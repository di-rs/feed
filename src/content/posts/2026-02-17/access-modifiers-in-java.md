A thorough breakdown of Java's four access modifiers—private, default (package-private), protected, and public—applied to variables, classes, methods, and constructors. The guide emphasizes best practices like using private fields with public getters/setters to achieve proper encapsulation, and clarifies why top-level classes cannot be declared private or protected. Practical code examples illustrate each modifier's scope and use case.
