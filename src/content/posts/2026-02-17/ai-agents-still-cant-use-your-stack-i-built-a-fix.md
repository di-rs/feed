Despite llms.txt making documentation machine-readable and Agent Skills enabling agents to run workflows, there's still a manual gap between the two that doesn't scale. The author built txtskills, a tool that automatically converts documentation (via an llms.txt URL or docs base URL) into installable Agent Skills for coding agents like Claude Code, VS Code, and others. This bridges the docs-to-execution gap without manual skill authoring.
