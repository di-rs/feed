Drawing on task-exposure data from Brookings, OpenAI, and Goldman Sachs, this article argues that the "Great Inversion" is already underway — QA engineers face 82% AI automation exposure while plumbers sit at just 12%. Generative AI targets cognitive screen work natively (code, text, analysis), while physical dexterity remains stubbornly hard to automate. The jobs most exposed aren't the ones lifting heavy objects, but the ones working inside a terminal or IDE.
