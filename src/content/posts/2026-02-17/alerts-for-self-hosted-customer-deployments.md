Distr, an open-source platform for distributing software to on-prem and air-gapped customers, now supports configurable alerts so vendors get notified about failed updates, crash loops, or unreachable deployments before customers open a ticket. The system supports both vendor-controlled alerts (set once, apply everywhere) and customer-managed alerts through a dual-portal approach. This closes the visibility gap that plagues software vendors whose monitoring stops at the edge of customer-controlled infrastructure.
