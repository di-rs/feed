This post makes the case for using free open-source scrapers on Apify as an alternative to expensive Amazon product research SaaS tools like Jungle Scout. It covers how to extract ASINs, pricing, ratings, and BSR data without paying monthly subscription fees. The approach suits indie developers and researchers who need Amazon data for price monitoring or competitor analysis on a budget.
