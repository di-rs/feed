The author cloned most of Linear's core functionality in 20 prompts using Claude Code over a couple of evenings, illustrating a growing threat to SaaS economics: organizations will increasingly build internal tools instead of buying external vendors, and AI agents are beginning to replace entire SaaS categories altogether. This follows prior essays on how agentic coding is eating SaaS and driving sharp declines in software company valuations.
