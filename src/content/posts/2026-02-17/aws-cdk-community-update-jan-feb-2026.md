The AWS CDK community merged 150+ pull requests from Dec 2025 through Feb 2026, with 25+ first-time contributors across EKS, Bedrock, ECS, and 15+ other services. Key highlights include CDK Mixins (preview) for composable construct abstractions, Kiro AI-powered CDK/CloudFormation assistance, built-in linear/canary ECS deployment strategies, and EKS Hybrid Nodes support for integrating on-premises infrastructure with EKS clusters. CloudWatch Logs also gains deletion protection to prevent accidental data loss.
