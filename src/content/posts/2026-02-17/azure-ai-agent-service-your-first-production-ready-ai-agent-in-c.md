Azure AI Agent Service is a managed Microsoft platform that takes the heavy lifting out of building production AI agents—handling conversation state, tool calling, streaming, and rate limits out of the box. This series introduces the service with a first C# agent, then progresses through tool extensions, multi-agent orchestration with Semantic Kernel, production patterns like state management and observability, and final deployment to Azure AI Foundry. It's aimed at developers who've previously worked with lower-level OpenAI SDKs and want a more structured, scalable path to production.
