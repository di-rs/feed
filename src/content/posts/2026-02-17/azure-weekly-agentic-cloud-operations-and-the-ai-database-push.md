Microsoft Azure announced a new agentic cloud operations model where specialized AI agents actively manage the full cloud lifecycle — from migration and deployment to observability, resiliency, and cost optimization. Claude Opus 4.6 also landed in Microsoft Foundry with a 1M token context window, purpose-built for agentic coding and enterprise workflows. These announcements signal Azure's strategic bet that AI agents will become the default way to operate cloud infrastructure at scale.
