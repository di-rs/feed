An indie developer shares the journey of building an AI host for a multiplayer lateral thinking puzzle game (TurtleNoir), evolving from a simple Gemini API setup to a cost-efficient dual-layer architecture after viral growth drove costs to $5 in 30 minutes. The breakthrough came from switching to DeepSeek V3.2 combined with context caching, which cut costs by over 90% by paying the "memory cost" of puzzle rules and backstory just once per session. The article explores how real-time inference alone isn't enough for immersive AI experiences and why going beyond standard RAG patterns is necessary for sustainable production deployments.
