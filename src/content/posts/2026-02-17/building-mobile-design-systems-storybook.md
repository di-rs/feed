Storybook 10 integrated into a TypeScript React Native project eliminates the tedious reload-navigate-trigger workflow by letting developers build and test components in complete isolation, without needing Redux providers or real API calls. Using the new CSF Factories format, stories are fully type-safe and match production code quality, making it easy to validate edge cases like long translations or small screen sizes with a single Control toggle. The author argues Storybook should be treated as a core dependency rather than a "nice-to-have," given how much time it saves when styling deeply nested or error-state components.
