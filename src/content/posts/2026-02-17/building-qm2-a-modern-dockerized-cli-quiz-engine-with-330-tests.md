QM2 is a terminal-based quiz engine built for developers, featuring four question types, flashcard mode, and full CSV/JSON portability — built with Rich for UI and Questionary for interactive prompts. The project prioritizes reliability with 330+ tests, 86% coverage, and secure OIDC-based publishing to PyPI via GitHub Actions, and runs in Docker for full environment isolation.
