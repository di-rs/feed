Rather than defaulting to the "best" model, this post frames AI model selection as an economics and risk tradeoff — using a practical decision tree based on output audience, verifiability, context length, and privacy constraints. The mapping: GPT for fast iteration with verifiers, Claude for complex reasoning and consistency, and local models for privacy-sensitive or compliance-constrained tasks.
