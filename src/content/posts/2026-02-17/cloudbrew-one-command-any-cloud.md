CloudBrew is an open-source CLI that lets developers spin up cloud resources across AWS, GCP, and Azure with a single command — no long configs, no confusing setup. It handles smart prompts for missing arguments, secure login checks, and cross-cloud resource mapping. The goal is to make cloud infrastructure feel as simple as brew install and as instant as a local command.
