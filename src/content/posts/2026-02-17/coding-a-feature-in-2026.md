A concise look at how engineers ship features in 2026: AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex) handle the implementation while developers focus on describing requirements — ideally via voice transcription — and validating results through local debugging tools and minimal test suites. The author emphasizes that manual testing of every AI-generated change remains essential for now, and that "prototype first, design it later" beats over-planning. Plan/interview modes that ask clarifying questions are highlighted as an underused trick for better feature scoping.
