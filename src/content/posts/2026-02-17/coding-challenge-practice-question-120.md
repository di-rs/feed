This coding challenge asks for a function that removes duplicate characters from a string while preserving lexicographic order—essentially finding the smallest unique subsequence. The solution uses a monotonic stack combined with a character frequency counter and a Set to track what's already in the stack, enabling greedy decisions about when to pop and replace characters. It's a classic problem that tests understanding of stack manipulation, greedy algorithms, and character frequency tracking.
