A developer tests AI glasses for coding assistance and finds the integrated AI too imprecise at reading screen content to be useful for debugging or code explanation. Pivoting from productivity tool to self-tracking device, they build a "life commits" system that captures hourly photos with the glasses, classifies them using Apple's Vision framework (workspace, outdoors, social, etc.), and creates a timestamped record of the day—like Git commits but for your life. The key insight: AI glasses may be more valuable for self-understanding than direct workflow enhancement.
