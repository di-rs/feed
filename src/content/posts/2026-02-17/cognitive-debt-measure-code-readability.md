cognitive-debt is a tool that measures the mental effort required to understand and modify code — a metric that traditional linters like ESLint and SonarQube completely miss. Three new features include a Change Impact Forecaster (predicts refactoring risk before you touch anything), Cognitive Debt Diff (tracks complexity trends over time), and improved coupling analysis. It fills the gap between "code that passes tests" and "code humans can actually reason about."
