A philosophy student taking an intro programming class for gen-ed credits discovers that self-directed learning through Boot.dev is advancing far faster than the structured college course, completing Python, Linux, and a first project in the time the class covered basic output formatting. The author attributes the speed gap to intrinsic motivation, immediate feedback loops from running code, and gamification elements like XP and digital rewards. The piece makes a compelling case that coding is uniquely suited to self-directed learning because the compiler/interpreter provides instant, objective feedback without needing an instructor.
