A seasoned software engineer who's skeptical of vibe coding makes a nuanced case for one specific use case: using AI-generated prototypes as a communication bridge between product managers and developers to align mental models before actual development begins. The argument is grounded in cognitive science — visualization reduces misalignment between stakeholders who have fundamentally different mental representations of a product. The author is careful to note this isn't about replacing skilled developers, but about using vibe-coded prototypes as shared artifacts that make implicit expectations explicit earlier in the process.
