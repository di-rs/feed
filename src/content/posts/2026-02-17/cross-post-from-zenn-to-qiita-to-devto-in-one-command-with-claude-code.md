Claude Code generated a Python script (publish.py) that automatically converts Zenn-specific syntax—:::message blocks, :::details, and /images/ paths—into platform-compatible Markdown for Qiita and Dev.to. The tool supports creating new posts, auto-updating existing ones by title search, canonical URL injection for SEO, and a dry-run preview mode for safe verification. This eliminates the manual conversion errors that arise when cross-posting technical articles across multiple publishing platforms.
