A developer built a fully phone-based daily haiku agent using Termux cron on Android, the OpenAI API via raw HTTP requests (no SDK), Supabase as a serverless backend, and Netlify for a static frontend — with zero GitHub secrets. Every morning at 7 AM it picks a poet, generates a haiku, publishes it to a public blog, and sends a Telegram notification, all from a Samsung phone. The project is a practical lesson in how much you can automate without any cloud infrastructure.
