A comprehensive guide to C# delegates and events, covering type-safe method references, multicast delegates, and event-driven architecture patterns. Delegates act as variables holding method references, enabling flexible and loosely coupled code where multiple handlers can be chained together. Events build on this foundation to let classes notify the outside world when specific actions occur.
