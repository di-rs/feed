An in-depth exploration of major AI model categories — from simple linear regression to complex neural networks — explaining how training data quality and epoch count shape each model's learning. Different AI problems require entirely different architectures, data volumes, and training strategies. Understanding these distinctions is essential for anyone building or working with modern AI systems.
