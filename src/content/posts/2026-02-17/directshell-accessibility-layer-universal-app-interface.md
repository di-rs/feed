DirectShell is an open-source primitive that exposes Windows' UI Automation accessibility layer as a machine-readable interface, giving AI agents structured, real-time access to every button, text field, and menu across all GUI apps — without screenshots or vision models. The author argues this 29-year-old Windows capability makes current screenshot-based agent architectures (OpenAI Operator, Anthropic Computer Use, etc.) effectively obsolete. The tool is released openly so defenders and researchers can learn about this surface simultaneously.
