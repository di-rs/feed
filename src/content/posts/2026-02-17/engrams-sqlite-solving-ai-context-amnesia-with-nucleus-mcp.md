Nucleus-MCP v1.0.7 introduces a local-first memory model using SQLite to give AI agents like Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude persistent context without relying on cloud intermediaries. The tool implements "engrams" — structured memory units — as a sovereign command deck that treats AI memory as durable data rather than throwaway logs.
