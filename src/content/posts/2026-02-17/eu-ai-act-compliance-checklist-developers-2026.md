The EU AI Act now applies to any developer building with AI models like GPT-4, Claude, or LLaMA who ships to EU users — with enforcement phases rolling out between 2025 and 2027. The regulation classifies AI systems into four risk levels (Unacceptable, High, Limited, Minimal), each carrying different compliance obligations ranging from full documentation and human oversight for high-risk systems to simple transparency disclosures for chatbots. A practical 10-point checklist covers risk classification, documentation, data governance, transparency requirements, and monitoring, with the most critical window being 2026 when most high-risk AI system obligations come into effect.
