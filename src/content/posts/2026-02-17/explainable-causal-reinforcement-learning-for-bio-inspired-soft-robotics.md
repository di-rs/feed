Inspired by watching an octopus perform deliberate self-maintenance while scuba diving, this research applies explainable causal reinforcement learning to bio-inspired soft robotics—requiring agents to not just learn how to act but understand why actions lead to outcomes. The system bakes ethical auditability in from the start, enabling human oversight and trust in autonomous robotic decision-making. It sits at the intersection of causal ML, reinforcement learning, soft robotics, and responsible AI design.
