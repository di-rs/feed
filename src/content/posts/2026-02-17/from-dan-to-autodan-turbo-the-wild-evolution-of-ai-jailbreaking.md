AI jailbreaking has evolved from manual "DAN" persona tricks to AutoDAN-Turbo — a full adversarial agent that autonomously learns and refines attack strategies using a strategy library and scorer LLM. For AI agents with real tool access, successful jailbreaks are especially dangerous since they can trigger unauthorized real-world actions like database deletions. Developers should adopt adversarial red-teaming, runtime monitoring, architectural guardrails, and least-privilege principles to protect agent systems.
