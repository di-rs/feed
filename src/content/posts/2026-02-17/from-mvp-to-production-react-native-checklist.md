Shipping a React Native app to production requires a solid baseline of practices across environment configuration, build variants, and versioning to avoid the classic pitfalls of hardcoded URLs and staging builds hitting production. The checklist covers environment variables with react-native-config or Expo, Android product flavors and iOS schemes for proper per-env isolation, automated version bumps in CI, and deep-linking setup — all before touching the store submission process. It's designed as a living starting point that teams can expand based on their specific stack and compliance requirements.
