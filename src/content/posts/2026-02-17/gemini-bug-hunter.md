Gemini Bug Hunter is a Node.js CLI that scans your codebase, strips sensitive data, and sends code chunks to Gemini 2.5 Flash to receive a vulnerability report with risk levels and fix recommendations. Built out of a mix of burnout and curiosity about staying valuable in a post-layoff tech market, the project treats Gemini as the reasoning brain rather than just a friendly assistant. It's a practical example of combining AI with security tooling for everyday developer workflows.
