This research project developed a pipeline to generate realistic Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) wafer images from user-provided segmentation masks, enabling intuitive control over micro-structure generation. To build the required paired dataset, the team converted the MIIC dataset (originally for anomaly detection) into segmentation maps using SAM-2, producing precise segmentation results without additional training. The work was conducted in collaboration with Applied Materials and aims to make SEM image synthesis more accessible for semiconductor industry applications.
