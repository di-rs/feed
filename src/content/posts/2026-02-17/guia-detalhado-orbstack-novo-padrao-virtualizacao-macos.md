OrbStack is positioned as the new gold standard for macOS virtualization — the "WSL2 that Mac always deserved" — offering full Docker Desktop compatibility without changing existing scripts. This Portuguese-language guide covers installation via Homebrew, initial setup, and migration from Docker Desktop, recommending a clean start if your environment is messy. It's optimized for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and Intel, with dramatically faster startup and lower resource usage than alternatives.
