Google is celebrating Lunar New Year 2026 — the Year of the Horse — with new features across its products including a global Doodle honoring the fire horse, curated content on Google TV, and Gemini-powered holiday preparation tools. Users in APAC can access special Google Play promotions and gaming events, while Chrome users can update their browser with designs from the Asian & Pacific Islander Artists Series. Additional festive features include local Asian-owned business discovery in Search and Maps, and Chinatown exploration via Google Arts & Culture.
