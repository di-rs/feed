A developer details how they built an AI-powered virtual try-on system for a men's clothing brand specializing in traditional Middle Eastern attire like Kandoras and Thobes. The stack combines Next.js 14, TypeScript, Gemini 2.5 Image Pro via Runware SDK, and Cloudflare R2 for image storage—with presigned URL uploads to minimize server bottlenecks. A key innovation is identity-preserving prompt engineering that maintains the user's facial features and body type rather than applying generic model aesthetics.
