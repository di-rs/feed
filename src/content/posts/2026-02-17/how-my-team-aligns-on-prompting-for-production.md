A Google Cloud engineering team shares how they stopped treating LLM prompting like casual chatting and started treating it like code, establishing rigorous practices for non-deterministic AI systems used in automated sample code generation.

Their key practices include pair-prompting, code review for prompts, and making intent explicit to achieve consistent, trustworthy results in production.
