A step-by-step guide to running Podman Quadlets on Raspberry Pi with Debian 13 (Trixie), covering installation, user lingering for boot-time persistence, and creating systemd-integrated container services. Quadlets bridge the gap between Podman containers and systemd, giving you a native Linux service experience without Docker. The guide walks through the full setup from apt install to enabling containers at boot.
