The author built Revive, an automated payment recovery tool for SaaS businesses on Stripe, to tackle involuntary churn—the estimated 9% of MRR that most SaaS companies silently lose when payments fail and go unrecovered. Revive applies smarter retry schedules based on failure type (insufficient funds vs. expired card vs. do-not-honor) and sends dunning emails timed for when users actually open and act on them, with a 5-minute setup. This is an honest, live launch diary starting from $0 revenue, contrasting the typical retrospective success stories.
