A developer built a Telegram bot that conducts realistic technical interviews powered by Claude Sonnet — users pick a role (Backend/Frontend/QA/DevOps), tech stack, and difficulty, then get scored answers (0-10) with detailed feedback across 5 questions. The stack combines grammY, Node.js 22, SQLite, and faster-whisper for voice input (supporting text or spoken answers), with Telegram Stars for payments and a Nuxt 3 landing page on Cloudflare Pages. Voice input proved to be a game-changer for system design questions, enabling a more natural interview simulation experience.
