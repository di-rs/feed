A beginner's learning journal covering Day 1 of a Selenium Java course, introducing core Java concepts like JDK, JRE, JVM, and JIT alongside how to compile and run Java programs via the command line. The trainer encouraged documenting learning through blog posts rather than traditional notes, making this part of a longer series. Content is suitable for absolute beginners looking to understand Java fundamentals before diving into browser automation.
