A darkly humorous take on the universal laws of software development: temporary hacks that become critical infrastructure, rewrite cycles that always end with two systems instead of one, and the microservices enlightenment that doubles complexity instead of solving it. Told from the perspective of a battle-worn senior engineer who has watched these cycles repeat across every organization, the piece is equal parts cautionary tale and dry comedy. Nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution, and the seniors always look tired because they've seen how this ends.
