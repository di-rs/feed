EasyRetro (originally FunRetro, founded 2015) does one thing — sprint retrospective boards with sticky notes, voting, and action items — and does it without feature bloat. Kollabe (launched 2022) takes the opposite bet, combining retros, planning poker, async standups, AI grouping, and AI summaries into a single platform to replace multiple tools. The choice between them comes down to whether your team values focused simplicity or an all-in-one agile ceremony suite.
