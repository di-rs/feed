A beginner-friendly explainer of Kubernetes architecture using a restaurant chain analogy — Kubernetes acts as a smart manager assigning orders (workloads) across kitchens (servers), adding extra cooks during rush hours (auto-scaling), and reassigning work if a kitchen goes down (self-healing). The Control Plane (API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd) is the decision-making layer, while the Data Plane (Nodes, Kubelet, Container Runtime, Kube-Proxy) handles actual execution. Together they deliver container orchestration, auto-scaling, load balancing, and high availability.
