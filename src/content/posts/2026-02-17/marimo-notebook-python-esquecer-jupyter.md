Marimo is a reactive, open-source Python notebook that solves Jupyter's notorious "hidden state" problem by making cells aware of their dependencies — when one cell changes, all dependent cells automatically re-execute, like a spreadsheet. Unlike Jupyter's opaque .ipynb format, Marimo stores notebooks as plain .py files, making version control and git diffs completely painless. The article argues this reactive model fundamentally changes how Python notebooks should work for reproducible data science.
