A comprehensive guide to Python's asyncio covering coroutines, event loops, and awaitable objects — and how proper async patterns can reduce I/O-heavy operations from minutes to mere seconds. The article goes beyond slapping async/await everywhere, covering production-ready patterns, subtle pitfalls like overfitting concurrency, and knowing when async is actually the right tool. Essential reading for anyone building scalable Python services in 2026.
