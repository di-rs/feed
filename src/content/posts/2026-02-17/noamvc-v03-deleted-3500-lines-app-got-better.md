NoamVC v0.3 is a P2P encrypted voice chat app (built with Tauri 2 + React 19 + TypeScript) that improved significantly after deleting 3,500 lines of code, with the headline feature being a new room admission system where the host must explicitly approve every join request. The update also adds in-app bug reporting to Firestore and refines the E2E encryption model using Insertable Streams + PBKDF2. The codebase reduction highlights how over-engineering often hurts more than it helps.
