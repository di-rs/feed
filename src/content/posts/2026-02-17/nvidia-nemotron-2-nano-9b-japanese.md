NVIDIA has released Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Japanese, a compact 9B parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Nejumi Leaderboard 4 for models under 10B parameters. Built on the proven Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 architecture and high-quality Japanese synthetic data from Nemotron-Personas-Japan, the model combines advanced Japanese language understanding with strong agentic capabilities. It targets Japanese enterprise AI deployments requiring on-premise operation, fast fine-tuning cycles, and efficient multi-agent system prototyping without the overhead of larger models.
