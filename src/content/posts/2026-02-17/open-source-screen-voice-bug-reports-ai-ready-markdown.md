markupR is an open-source (MIT) tool that records your screen and voice simultaneously, then automatically transcribes the narration, extracts relevant frames, and outputs a structured AI-ready markdown bug report with inline screenshots. It eliminates the manual overhead of bug reporting in AI-assisted dev workflows, and supports BYOK for cloud models or fully local options with a free-forever core. The project is seeking feedback on where existing bug-report handoffs break and whether the output format works in real projects.
