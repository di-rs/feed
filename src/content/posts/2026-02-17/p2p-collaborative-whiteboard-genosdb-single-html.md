GenosBoard is a full-featured real-time collaborative whiteboard that runs entirely peer-to-peer using GenosDB, requiring zero backend code — all state sync and persistence happens directly between browsers. It uses a hybrid model combining a graph database for persistent state (shapes, positions) and a lightweight ephemeral channel for high-frequency data like live cursor positions that never touches the database. The entire app fits in a single HTML file, serving as a blueprint for next-generation decentralized collaborative tools.
