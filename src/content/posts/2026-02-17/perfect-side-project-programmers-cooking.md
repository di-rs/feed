A developer reflects on how cooking and programming share surprisingly similar mental models — both start with following documentation before evolving into pattern recognition and intuitive problem-solving. Debugging a dish works just like debugging code: analyzing what went wrong, adjusting inputs, and iterating until you reach a stable build. The author argues that cooking is the ideal side project for engineers because it builds real-world systems thinking skills while also being personally rewarding and healthy.
