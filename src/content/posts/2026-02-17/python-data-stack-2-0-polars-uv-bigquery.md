A Portuguese technical manifesto for data engineers ready to abandon the legacy stack (pandas, pip, Jupyter) for modern Rust-based alternatives. The guide maps one-to-one replacements: uv for pip/poetry/virtualenv (10-100x faster installs), Polars for pandas (multi-threaded, SIMD-optimized), DuckDB for local OLAP, BigQuery bigframes for petabyte-scale data using pandas syntax, and Marimo for reactive Git-friendly notebooks. Especially compelling for Apple Silicon users who want to actually use all the cores they paid for.
