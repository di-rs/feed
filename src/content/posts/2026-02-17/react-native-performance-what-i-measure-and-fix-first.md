A practical guide on systematically measuring and improving React Native app performance across startup time, FPS, list scroll, memory, and bundle size. The author recommends using FlatList or FlashList with proper windowing, memoizing components to prevent unnecessary re-renders, and offloading heavy computation from the JS thread. The standout advice is establishing per-release performance baselines so regressions become obvious rather than a vague "it feels slower."
