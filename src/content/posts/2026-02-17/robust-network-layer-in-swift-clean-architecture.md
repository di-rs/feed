This article walks through building a reusable, type-safe, and testable network layer for iOS apps from scratch using Clean Architecture principles, Swift Generics, and Async/Await. The approach uses type-safe enums to centralize API endpoints and eliminates hardcoded strings scattered across ViewModels, while proper error categorization replaces generic failure handling. It's suitable for interview prep or production refactoring and scales cleanly as the app grows.
