The GitHub Secure Open Source Fund helped 67 critical AI-stack projects — including curl, Python, Node.js, and LLVM — accelerate security fixes and strengthen ecosystem resilience. By linking funding directly to verified security outcomes and providing hands-on training, the initiative demonstrates that open source infrastructure deserves real investment. As AI systems increasingly depend on these foundational libraries, securing them is essential to preventing cascading vulnerabilities across production pipelines.
