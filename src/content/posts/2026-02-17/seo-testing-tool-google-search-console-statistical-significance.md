A new CLI tool called SEO Testing Tool v1.0.0 connects to Google Search Console and uses Welch's t-test to determine whether SEO changes are statistically significant rather than just noise from natural traffic fluctuation. Features include OAuth2 login, a local SQLite database for historical tracking, p-values, ASCII charts, and Excel/CSV export — all installable via npm. The goal is to bring rigorous statistical testing to SEO analysis, helping practitioners distinguish genuine ranking improvements from random variance.
