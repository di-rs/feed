SharePoint migrations are less about moving files and more about moving habits, permissions, and the institutional knowledge that only exists in the heads of long-tenured employees—a lesson reinforced by discovering orphaned document libraries nobody knew how to govern. The author shares real-world insights from enterprise on-prem to cloud migrations, focusing on the gap between least-privilege security ideals and how teams actually collaborate. Success requires understanding organizational behavior as much as technical configuration.
