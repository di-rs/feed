A decade-experienced data engineer argues that LLMs are "glorified autocompleters" that consistently fail to produce complete, structured, scalable software—and proposes the "JSON Voorhees" methodology as a systems-engineering approach to deterministically control LLM behavior. The piece critiques the current AI hype cycle around demo magic and the shift needed from naive prompt engineering to principled system design. It frames the evolution as moving from training "prompt dogs" to engineering "racehorses" through structured JSON-driven system contracts.
