Most teams suffer from a signal problem, not a lack-of-feedback problem — raw user input rots quickly because it's missing decision context, mixes incompatible "species" (crash dumps, UX complaints, feature requests) in one inbox, and is heavily biased toward vocal extremes while the silent majority stays invisible. A functional feedback system is an end-to-end pipeline — capture → clarify → categorize → verify → decide → ship → measure → communicate — where a breakdown at any stage collapses the whole process into developer burnout and product drift. Designing explicitly for the tension between users wanting immediate fixes and engineers needing reproducible cases is what separates teams that improve from teams that just collect opinions.
