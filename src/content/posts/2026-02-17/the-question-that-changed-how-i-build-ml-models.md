The author describes how a mentor's simple "what's the use case?" question transformed their ML approach from metric-chasing to problem-solving. By rebuilding a housing price model with real Sydney transaction data, domain-specific features (suburb clustering, price-per-sqm normalization, inflation adjustment), the R² jumped from 0.62 to 0.95. The lesson: define the "why" and real-world audience before choosing features or evaluating accuracy.
