Vonage kicks off a "Dev Discussion" series focused on the human side of software development, starting with a community question about what music developers listen to while coding. The post shares a fun bit of trivia: the iconic hold music "Opus No. 1" was composed in 1989 by a self-described "Yanni-loving computer nerd" messing around in his parents' garage. Developers are invited to share their coding playlists and habits in the comments.
