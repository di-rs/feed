The author proposes FlyWeb, a simple open standard for making websites machine-readable via a JSON manifest at /.well-known/flyweb.json—analogous to robots.txt but telling machines what content you have rather than what to avoid. The spec lets AI agents know what content a site offers, where to get it as clean structured data, how to query it, and how to credit the source. The motivation is preventing AI companies from building incompatible proprietary scraping pipelines by establishing an open convention first.
