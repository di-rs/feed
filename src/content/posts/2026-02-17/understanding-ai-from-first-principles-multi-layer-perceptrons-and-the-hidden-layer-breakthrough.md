This post explains why single-layer perceptrons fundamentally cannot solve XOR — a limitation proven by Minsky and Papert in 1969 that triggered the first AI winter — and how introducing hidden layers in multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) unlocked the ability to learn non-linearly separable patterns. The visual walkthrough of the XOR geometry makes the "linearly separable" concept intuitive for beginners building up from first principles.
