TanStack Virtual is a headless virtualization library for React that renders only visible list items plus a small buffer, dramatically reducing DOM node count and improving scroll performance with large datasets. Unlike opinionated UI libraries, it gives developers full control over markup and styling while handling all the virtualization math (ranges, offsets, sizes). The article walks through installation, setup, and practical implementation for handling lists with thousands of entries smoothly.
