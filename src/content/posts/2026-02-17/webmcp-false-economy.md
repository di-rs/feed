WebMCP — a proposed JavaScript API by Microsoft and Google engineers that lets sites declare tool contracts via navigator.modelContext — sits in an architectural dead zone: it demands developer effort like server-side MCP but routes unnecessarily through the browser. The author argues that sites willing to invest in agent optimization should expose server-side MCP directly, while the long tail of the web that won't adopt new protocols is better served by the browser synthesizing existing HTML, ARIA, and accessibility tree data. Two decades of metadata adoption history (Open Graph, microformats) support the skepticism.
