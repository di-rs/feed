Arbitrum Open House evaluates hackathon submissions on three transparent criteria — execution quality (functional MVP with docs and a working demo), problem-solution fit, and traction — removing the black-box mystery of typical hackathon judging. Top teams in India won by shipping high-precision math using Q96.48 fixed-point arithmetic in Stylus with trade segmentation, fully running on Arbitrum. Knowing the framework upfront gives builders a clear edge when crafting their submissions.
