Part 7 of an open-source Pain Tracker series explores how to build useful documentation outputs for work-related injury workflows (WorkSafeBC) without making dangerous overclaims like "clinically validated" or "compliant." The approach generates local PDF summaries of self-reported data with explicit disclaimers, keeping the workflow local-first and fully user-controlled rather than server-processed. The article argues that being defensibly honest about what software actually does — and doesn't do — is both ethically correct and a stronger engineering position.
