A beginner's tutorial on C# while loops demonstrating a program that appends 'a' to a user-entered word until it reaches 15 characters, illustrating the key concepts of condition-based repetition and mandatory state change. The article contrasts while (pre-check) vs do-while (executes at least once) and emphasizes always asking whether a loop will eventually terminate. A practice task challenges readers to modify the stopping condition while thinking through the risks of infinite loops.
