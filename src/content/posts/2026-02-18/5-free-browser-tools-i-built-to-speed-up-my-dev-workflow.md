A developer built 5 client-side browser utilities to eliminate common dev micro-tasks: a JSON formatter/validator, regex tester with real-time matching, JWT decoder, cron expression parser with plain-English output, and a diff checker. All tools run 100% in the browser with zero ads, no signup, and no data sent to servers. They're free and open-source, hosted on GitHub Pages.
