The article highlights five free, no-signup tools that generate realistic, checksum-valid test data for QA engineers: namso.io for Luhn-valid credit card numbers by BIN, randomiban.co for MOD-97-valid IBANs across 30+ countries, randomimei.com for valid 15-digit device IMEIs, and randommac.com for MAC addresses. These tools eliminate the pain of hardcoded test values and manual checksum validation, generating bulk valid data in seconds for payment, banking, telecom, and device management testing.
