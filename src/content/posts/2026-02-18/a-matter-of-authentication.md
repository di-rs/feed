The author walks through setting up AWS Cognito User Pools to secure a single-page application, covering federated identity providers, app clients for JWT token generation, and HTTP API Gateway authorization. Cognito provides a managed alternative to complex IAM/Active Directory setups and also supports M2M OAuth 2.0 flows, making it useful for agentic applications that need secure tool access. The post explores using HTTP API Gateway (instead of REST API Gateway) with Cognito as a JWT authorizer.
