DEV (dev.to) is officially merging with Major League Hacking (MLH), the world's largest developer programs platform serving over 1 million developers across 100 countries. The original DEV team remains in place, and the move is framed as a resource-sharing collaboration to keep the platform sustainable and grow both the Forem open source project and MLH's IRL developer events. Founder Ben Halpern sees it as a new beginning after nearly a decade of building the community.
