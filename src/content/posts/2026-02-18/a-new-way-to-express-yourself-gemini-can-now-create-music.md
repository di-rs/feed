Google's Gemini has gained music creation capabilities through a multi-modal framework that includes a text-to-music encoder and music generation model, allowing users to compose music from lyrics or descriptive text prompts. This represents a significant extension of Gemini's language capabilities into audio generation, joining the growing field of AI-powered creative tools. The technical analysis explores the architecture components including how user text input is encoded and transformed into musical output.
