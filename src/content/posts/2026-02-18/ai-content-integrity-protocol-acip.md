The robots.txt handshake that once governed how crawlers accessed web content is broken in the AI era, as AI agents can't be reliably identified or blocked using traditional mechanisms. Cloudflare's "Markdown for Agents" feature—which reduces page token usage by up to 80% (e.g. 16,180 tokens down to 3,150)—highlights the urgent need for a formal AI Content Integrity Protocol (ACIP). The author argues this is one of the most critical and overlooked infrastructure problems facing the web today.
