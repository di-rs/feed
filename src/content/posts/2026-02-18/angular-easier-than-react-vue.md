A developer with 5 years of Angular experience argues that Angular's opinionated "batteries included" structure — with built-in CLI, RxJS, TypeScript enforcement, and NgModules — produces faster onboarding than React's fragmented ecosystem or Vue's flexibility-turned-spaghetti at scale. Enterprise adoption at companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM reflects Angular's edge in large-team productivity, with a reported 20% higher productivity for Angular devs in large teams per a 2024 Stack Overflow survey. The author contends that having all tools standardized up front reduces decision fatigue and makes the initial learning curve gentler despite Angular's reputation for complexity.
