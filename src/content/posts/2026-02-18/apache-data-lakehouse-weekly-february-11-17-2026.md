Apache Polaris graduated from the Apache Incubator this week, while the Iceberg community debated making root metadata JSON optional in V4 to improve streaming write performance for high-commit workloads. The Warsaw Apache Iceberg Europe Community Meetup on February 18 gathered contributors advancing V4 format evolution, Arrow IPC stream design, and Parquet ALP encoding. A vote to formalize AI-generated contribution guidelines for Iceberg also passed, marking a thoughtful step in open source governance.
