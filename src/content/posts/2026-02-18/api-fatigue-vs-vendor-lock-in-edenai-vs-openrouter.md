EdenAI and OpenRouter both address API fatigue by providing unified multi-provider AI access, but serve different needs: EdenAI excels at multi-modal workflows (text, vision, OCR, speech) with 60+ providers and no-code orchestration, while OpenRouter focuses on LLM routing with transparent per-model pricing and smart fallback options. If your stack is 80%+ LLM-based, OpenRouter's pricing transparency wins; for complex multi-modal pipelines, EdenAI's no-code builder is more powerful.
