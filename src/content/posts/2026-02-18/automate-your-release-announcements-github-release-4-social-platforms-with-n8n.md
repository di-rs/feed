A developer automated cross-platform release announcements using n8n workflow automation triggered by GitHub release events, posting automatically to Discord, Bluesky, Dev.to, and Qiita via a Cloudflare Tunnel-exposed instance. The n8n workflow handles message formatting per platform with JavaScript expressions and costs $0/month to run. This saves 15-20 minutes per release across multiple weekly releases.
