Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) builds a self-improving feedback loop where AI systematically tests prompt variations, measures performance, and evolves toward better results without manual intervention. Rather than spending hours on trial-and-error prompt engineering, APO treats prompt quality as an automated optimization problem where the model evaluates and iterates on its own outputs. The approach can dramatically improve prompt quality with minimal human effort across diverse LLM use cases.
