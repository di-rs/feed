Claude Code Hooks are shell commands, prompts, or agents that fire automatically at specific lifecycle points in Claude Code — think formatters on file write, or blockers before destructive commands. Unlike CLAUDE.md guidance (which Claude can ignore), hooks enforce behavior with zero exceptions using exit codes to allow, block, or report. Three hook types are supported: command hooks, prompt hooks, and agent hooks.
