Part 2 of a 5-part series on Azure AI Agent Service covers equipping agents with function calling, Code Interpreter, File Search, and custom tool integrations via real C# code examples. These capabilities let agents invoke .NET methods, execute Python code for calculations, and query documents using vector search and RAG patterns. Together they transform a basic LLM into an agent capable of real-world actions and live data access.
