Web accessibility ensures users with disabilities — particularly those relying on screen readers — can navigate and interact with your site effectively. Key techniques include using semantic HTML elements like `<button>` and `<nav>` instead of generic `<div>` tags, adding ARIA roles for complex components like tabs and accordions, ensuring keyboard tab order follows a logical visual flow, and maintaining sufficient color contrast. Building with accessibility in mind isn't a compliance checkbox — it's about making information and functionality available to every user regardless of physical or cognitive ability.
