While Mastra AI excels at TypeScript-first prototyping with clean workflow abstractions, production AI systems expose its limitations: no durable execution state, fragile long-running workflows, and observability that requires manual wiring of third-party tools. The article compares alternatives and highlights Calljmp as the strongest choice for production-grade, long-running AI workflows that need built-in state persistence, retries, and real-time monitoring. Teams that move from prototype to production often find they're rebuilding infrastructure rather than shipping application logic with framework-only approaches.
