BotEmail.ai provides AI agents with their own persistent @botemail.ai email addresses via a simple JSON API, eliminating the need for SMTP setup, DNS configuration, or any human intervention. Agents can create inboxes, read emails, handle attachments, and delete messages programmatically—ideal for verification codes, signup flows, and monitoring notifications autonomously. It's designed to keep AI agent autonomy loops unbroken when email interaction is required.
