A step-by-step tutorial for building a desktop color generator app using Python's Tkinter library, featuring a dark-themed UI with HEX, RGB, and HSL color value display. The app generates random colors, shows a live preview panel, and includes one-click clipboard copy buttons for each color format. All UI components are built from scratch using Tkinter's Frame, Label, and Button widgets along with Python's `colorsys` module for color space conversion.
