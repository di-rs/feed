This tutorial walks through building a Node.js TikTok sound trend analyzer that tracks rising audio clips in real-time using the SociaVault API and SQLite, focusing on identifying sounds in the "early adoption" phase (days 3–5)—the optimal window for viral reach. Automated polling via node-cron keeps data fresh without manual intervention, alerting creators before a sound peaks. The key insight is that trending sounds have a predictable lifecycle, and catching them at stage 2 can deliver 2–5× more algorithmic reach than original audio.
