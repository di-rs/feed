WXT is a Vite-inspired framework that dramatically simplifies cross-browser extension development (Chrome + Firefox) with TypeScript and React, offering hot reload, file-based entrypoints, and a unified browser API polyfill. The author builds a product clipper extension that persists state across pages and communicates with a SaaS backend — solving limitations that a bookmarklet approach couldn't handle. The article covers WXT's three execution contexts (background, content script, popup), message-passing architecture, and the full publishing workflow.
