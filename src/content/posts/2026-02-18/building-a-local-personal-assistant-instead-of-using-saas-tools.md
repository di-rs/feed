Rather than using fragmented SaaS tools, the author built Jason, a local personal assistant that runs one dedicated role per window to eliminate context pollution across projects. Traditional AI assistants blend all context into one conversation where the same keyword can mean different things depending on the project — causing noise and unreliable outputs. By enforcing separation between roles, Jason provides cleaner, more focused assistance for notes, documentation, and project management.
