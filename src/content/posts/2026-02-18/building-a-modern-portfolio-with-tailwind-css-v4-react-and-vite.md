This step-by-step guide walks through building a responsive developer portfolio using Tailwind CSS v4, React, and Vite — a stack chosen for lightning-fast builds (Vite HMR), component-based architecture (React), and utility-first styling with built-in dark mode support (Tailwind v4). Notably, Tailwind v4 uses a new Vite plugin that eliminates the need for a separate `postcss.config.js`, and global styles are configured via `@theme` blocks in CSS rather than a JS config file. The guide covers everything from project scaffolding and router setup with React Router to Axios-based API integration and dark mode toggling.
