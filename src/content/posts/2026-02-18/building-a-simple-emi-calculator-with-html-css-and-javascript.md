A developer builds a minimal EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculator using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, focusing on core front-end fundamentals without any frameworks or abstractions. The calculator implements the standard EMI formula (P × R × (1+R)^N / ((1+R)^N - 1)) with real-time updates triggered on every user input event. The project prioritizes clarity and correctness over optimization, making it a solid learning exercise for financial math logic and DOM event handling.
