LLM-based agents are stateless by default, and building persistent memory requires storing heterogeneous data (facts, episodes, preferences, tool outputs) with semantic retrieval across different models and frameworks. This deep-dive covers episodic vs. semantic vs. procedural memory distinctions, write/read pipeline design, vector search vs. BM25 vs. hybrid ranking with reciprocal rank fusion, and cross-agent interoperability across OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and open-source systems. The patterns draw from both cognitive science and distributed systems to create scalable, model-agnostic agent memory architectures.
