Most AI agents are stateless—they forget everything between sessions, making them ineffective for complex multi-step tasks or cross-agent coordination. This post explains how to build a universal memory layer using three types modeled after human cognition: episodic (specific experiences), semantic (general knowledge), and procedural (learned skills), combined with hybrid retrieval using vector search, keyword matching, and graph traversal. The guide includes runnable Python code for a working prototype and covers production failure modes and trade-offs.
