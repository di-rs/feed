A developer built a prototype AI Study Agent on top of their LMS using GitHub Copilot CLI in `/plan` mode for interactive architectural brainstorming before writing a single line of code, surfacing edge cases they hadn't considered. The resulting five-phase development workflow — plan, scaffold, implement, test, refine — balances speed with the developer's desired level of hands-on involvement. The article highlights how agentic AI tooling can collapse the gap between rough idea and working prototype for solo developers under time pressure.
