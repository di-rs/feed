Part 2 of a practical WordPress accessibility guide covers actionable steps including choosing accessibility-ready themes, maintaining proper heading hierarchy (H1→H2→H3), writing meaningful alt text focused on image purpose rather than description, and fixing color contrast issues. The guide emphasizes that accessibility isn't just ethical but also benefits SEO and legal compliance, and keeps the advice simple — no WCAG manuals required. A quick keyboard-tab test is suggested to instantly gauge your current theme's accessibility.
