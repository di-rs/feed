DotCommand v1.5.0 "The Intelligence Foundation" adds a privacy-first local analytics engine, an ML-based heuristic ranking system (Frequency + Recency + Context), automatic package.json dependency parsing for install suggestions, and custom JSON-based context rules. The backend upgrade lays groundwork for a v2.0 Dashboard Webview while keeping the core command runner under 5ms. A candid devlog including the author's aging PC crying under test-runner + screen-recording load.
