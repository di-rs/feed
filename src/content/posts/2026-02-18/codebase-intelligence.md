Codebase Intelligence is an open-source tool that transforms any GitHub repository into an interactive knowledge base using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It uses LangChain and OpenAI embeddings to ingest and chunk code, Pinecone for semantic vector search, and GPT-4 with the Vercel AI SDK to answer context-aware questions like "how is authentication handled?" backed by your actual code. Available at codebase-intelligence-nu.vercel.app with automated daily maintenance via GitHub Actions.
