Data modeling uses three levels of abstraction — conceptual, logical, and physical — each addressing different questions for different audiences at different stages of design. Conceptual models align business stakeholders on entities and relationships without technical details, logical models add precision with attributes, data types, and normalization rules, and physical models map those designs to specific database implementations. Skipping these planning steps leads to structural misalignment and redundancy that costs 10x more to fix after the database is in production.
