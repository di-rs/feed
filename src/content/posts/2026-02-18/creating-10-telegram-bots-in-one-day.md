Scaling from 5 to 10 Telegram bots in a single day using OpenClaw, with each bot assigned a dedicated domain (project dev, health, finance, customer service, etc.) and a model matched to its needs — Opus for code-heavy agents, DeepSeek/GPT-4o for lighter tasks. The real time sink was configuration: each bot needs account, agent, binding, and dmPolicy entries, and a single misconfiguration silently drops messages. The author notes that creation is easy but "connecting correctly is hard" — a universal lesson in system integration.
