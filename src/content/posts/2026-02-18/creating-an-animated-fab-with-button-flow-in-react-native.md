This tutorial walks through building an animated Floating Action Button (FAB) in React Native using react-native-reanimated v3, where a "Log" button expands into a horizontal list of options with smooth animations. When tapped, the FAB shrinks to a circle, its icon rotates 45° turning the plus into an X, and a horizontal meal-type selection menu slides in from above. The implementation uses shared values and animated styles to create a polished, interactive UI component suitable for food trackers or similar apps.
