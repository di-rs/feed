CVE-2026-1669 is a high-severity (CVSS 7.1) arbitrary file read vulnerability in Keras 3.0.0–3.13.1 that lets attackers embed malicious external storage links in HDF5 model files, causing the victim's system to read sensitive files (like /etc/passwd or AWS credentials) into memory as tensors when loading the model. The fix is to upgrade to Keras 3.13.2+, which now raises an error when external dataset links are detected in H5 files. Audit any model pipelines that load untrusted models and consider pre-loading checks using h5dump.
