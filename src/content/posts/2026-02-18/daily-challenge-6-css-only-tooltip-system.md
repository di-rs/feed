A CSS challenge to build a fully functional tooltip system without any JavaScript, using only pure CSS/HTML and pseudo-elements like `::before` or `::after`. The tooltip must support both hover and focus states for keyboard accessibility, feature a smooth fade-in or slide-up animation, and remain properly positioned to avoid viewport overflow. Bonus points for adding a beak triangle, and extra credit for implementing auto-flip behavior using pure CSS when near viewport edges.
