A project management dashboard that started as a static HTML file evolved into a Flask REST API backed by a simple JSON file for storage — no database, no frameworks, just vanilla JS on the frontend. The author tracks multi-project task statuses, meeting action items, and completion across a 3-column grid layout deployed on a local network machine via systemd. A practical "just enough" engineering story about valuing working software over over-engineered solutions.
