Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) occurs when user input is evaluated as template code rather than plain text — in Jinja2, this means attackers can craft payloads that access the Python runtime and execute arbitrary code. This hands-on tutorial demonstrates the vulnerability by building both a secure and an intentionally vulnerable Flask/Jinja2 app side-by-side, making it crystal clear exactly how developers accidentally introduce SSTI through unsafe `render_template_string` usage. Building and breaking your own vulnerable app is a far more effective learning approach than reading theoretical descriptions of attack patterns.
