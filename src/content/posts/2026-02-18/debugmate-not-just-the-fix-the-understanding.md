DebugMate is an AI debugging tool that replicates working with a senior developer — instead of immediately handing you a fix, it asks clarifying questions to build genuine understanding of what went wrong. With developers losing an average of 4.2 hours per week to blocking bugs and 73% unable to explain copy-pasted fixes, DebugMate targets the gap between getting a quick answer and actually learning why the bug happened. The tool aims to turn debugging from a growth-killing experience into a learning loop.
