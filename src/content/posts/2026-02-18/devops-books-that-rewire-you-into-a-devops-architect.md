A curated reading list of seven foundational DevOps books aimed at engineers who want to think like architects rather than tool operators, covering works like The Phoenix Project, Accelerate, Continuous Delivery, and The DevOps Handbook. The argument is that LLMs can answer questions but only deep reading builds the mental models and frameworks needed for systems-level thinking. Each book is framed around a specific architectural mindset shift — from understanding organizational chaos to defending architecture decisions with empirical data.
