In this DevOps learning series entry, the author discovers Linux's graphical interface is a modular layer on top of the OS, not built-in — powered by either X11 (veteran, supports remote display) or Wayland (modern, faster, more secure). Key concepts include the difference between Window Managers and Desktop Environments (GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE), Display Managers as login gatekeepers, and TTY virtual consoles as emergency escape hatches when the GUI freezes. Understanding these GUI layers is valuable for DevOps work even on headless servers.
