A concise guide to installing Docker Desktop and LM Studio on Ubuntu Linux to enable fully local LLM automation with privacy and offline capability. Docker Desktop provides pre-packaged MCP servers for integrating AI with web tools and databases, while LM Studio runs models like LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek locally via AppImage. The guide covers KVM verification, Docker Desktop DEB installation via apt, LM Studio AppImage extraction, and creating a desktop launcher so the app is discoverable via the Ubuntu app menu.
