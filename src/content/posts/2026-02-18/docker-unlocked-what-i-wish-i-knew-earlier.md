A beginner-friendly intro to Docker explaining how containerization solves the "it works on my machine" problem by packaging your app with all its dependencies into a portable, consistent environment.

Learning Docker early helps developers think like backend engineers — understanding ports, services, and the gap between local dev and production setups.
