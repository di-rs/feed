Waze has teamed up with World of Warcraft again, this time featuring Xal'atath — the Harbinger of the Void — as a turn-by-turn navigator with cryptic and biting commentary. Users can choose between "Void" or "Light" moods and drive with a custom Dragonhawk vehicle on the map. The experience is available globally in English, Spanish, and German as a preview for the upcoming World of Warcraft: Midnight expansion.
