WebForms Core is a server-command-driven UI automation framework where the server issues Action Control commands in a lightweight INI format and a small WebFormsJS client (40–110 KB) automatically interprets and applies them as DOM changes — eliminating manual AJAX, state management, and client-side routing. Compared to SPA frameworks like React or Vue, it offers dramatically lower development complexity, native SEO-friendliness, and automatic form data serialization including smart differential submissions in v2.0. The framework is positioned as an alternative to JavaScript fatigue, inspired by ASP.NET Web Forms but without the heavy ViewState or platform lock-in.
