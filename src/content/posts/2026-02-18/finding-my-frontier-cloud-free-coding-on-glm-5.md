A hands-on experiment running the frontier-sized GLM-5 model locally on an M3 Ultra Mac Studio with 512GB RAM for agentic coding — initial MLX attempts yielded 30+ minute response times, while GGUF quantization via llama.cpp showed more promise. The article documents the trial-and-error of finding a viable cloud-free AI coding setup, revealing the real performance constraints when pushing consumer hardware to its limits with massive open-source models.
