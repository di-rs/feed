Flutter's FloatingActionButton falls short when you need a button to stick to the bottom of a specific section and then settle into its natural position once scrolled into view. This tutorial walks through building a smart sticky button using scroll controllers and layout widgets to achieve context-aware positioning with full control over when and how the button appears. The pattern is reusable and adaptable, giving developers much more flexibility than the standard FAB for complex UI scenarios.
