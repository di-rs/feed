OpenFields is a free, open-source WordPress plugin that serves as a modern ACF Pro alternative, offering custom fields, repeaters, conditional logic, and REST API support with no paywalls. Built with React and Shadcn, its admin panel feels faster and more polished than most WordPress plugins, while the API deliberately mirrors ACF's familiar interface for easy migration. A developer shares their accidental discovery and real-world adoption of the plugin on a production project.
