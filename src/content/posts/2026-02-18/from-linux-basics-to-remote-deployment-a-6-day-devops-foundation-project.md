A developer documents a structured 6-day hands-on DevOps project progressing from Linux fundamentals and Bash scripting to containerizing a Flask app with Docker, configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy, and automating remote deployment to an AWS EC2 instance. Each day builds on the previous, covering Docker Compose, SSH, and shell automation, demonstrating how manual workflows become scripted provisioning pipelines. The project culminates in a single-script deployment that spins up a full remote environment from scratch.
