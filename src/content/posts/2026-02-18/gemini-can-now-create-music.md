Google has integrated Lyria 3, its latest generative music model, into the Gemini app, enabling users to create custom 30-second tracks with lyrics from text prompts or uploaded photos. The model brings automatic lyric generation, more creative control over style/vocals/tempo, and more musically complex output compared to earlier Lyria models. Lyria 3 is also rolling out to YouTube's Dream Track feature for creators in additional countries.
