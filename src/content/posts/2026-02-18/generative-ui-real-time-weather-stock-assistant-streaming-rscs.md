A deep dive into Generative UI — where an LLM acts as both data fetcher and UI designer, streaming interface components in real time rather than returning a static response. Built on the Vercel AI SDK and Next.js, the architecture combines Streaming UI, Tool Invocation via JSON Schema, and a Stateful Checkpointer to construct a Weather & Stock Assistant that assembles itself in the browser frame by frame. This marks the shift from traditional request-response web apps to AI-native interfaces.
