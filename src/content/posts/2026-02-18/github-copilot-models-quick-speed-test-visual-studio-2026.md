A hands-on comparison of five AI models available in GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode in Visual Studio 2026, all given the same real-world refactoring task: converting 6 repository classes from synchronous to async patterns with Entity Framework Core optimizations. The test cuts through the marketing hype to reveal which models actually get the work done fastest when shipping under deadline pressure.
