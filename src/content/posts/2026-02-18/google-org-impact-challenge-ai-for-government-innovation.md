Google.org is launching a $30 million global Impact Challenge to help nonprofits, social enterprises, and academic institutions develop AI-powered solutions for public services across health, resilience, and the economy. New data shows only 18% of governments believe they're using AI effectively despite 80% of public servants using it, highlighting the gap this initiative aims to close. Applications are open until April 3, 2026.
