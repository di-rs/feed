GraphQL is a query language originally developed by Meta (Facebook) as an alternative to REST APIs, now fully open-source and widely adopted. Unlike REST where endpoints return fixed data shapes, GraphQL lets clients request exactly the data they need, eliminating over-fetching and under-fetching. The article introduces new developers to GraphQL concepts by comparing it to the familiar REST approach and explaining when each is the right choice.
