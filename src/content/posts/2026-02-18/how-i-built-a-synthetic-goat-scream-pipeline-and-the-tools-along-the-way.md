A developer built a goat scream API as a creative way to learn API development, starting with YouTube scraping and a custom Streamlit app for audio detection and clipping, then switching to AI-generated audio via ElevenLabs for cleaner, labeled results. The project involved comparing multiple AI sound generation platforms (OpenAI, Adobe SFX, Kling, ElevenLabs) before settling on ElevenLabs for its quality and variety. It's a fun case study in creative dataset generation and the iterative tooling that comes with building novel APIs.
