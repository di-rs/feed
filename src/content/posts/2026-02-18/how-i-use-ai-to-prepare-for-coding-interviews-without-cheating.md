The author outlines an ethical AI-assisted coding interview prep workflow using Claude/ChatGPT as a Socratic tutor rather than a solution generator—asking for pattern-based problems, conceptual hints, and post-solve mock interview feedback. Core rules include never using AI during live interviews, understanding every line of generated code, and treating AI as a learning aid to build genuine understanding. This phased approach (pattern recognition → mock interviews → edge case stress testing) builds real competence while leveraging AI's strengths.
