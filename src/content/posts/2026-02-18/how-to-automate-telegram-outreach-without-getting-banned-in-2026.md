Successfully automating Telegram outreach requires a careful 2-3 week account warm-up strategy (gradually joining groups and adding contacts), randomized messaging patterns to fool anti-spam detection, and session-based account management with unique proxies per account. Rate limits scale by account age — from 10-20 messages/day for new accounts up to 200/day for aged accounts — with daily monitoring of FloodWait frequency, delivery rates, and report rates. Done correctly, cold Telegram outreach can achieve 12% response rates vs 2-3% for cold email, with open rates exceeding 85%.
