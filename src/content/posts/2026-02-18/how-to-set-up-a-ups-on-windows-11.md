A step-by-step guide to connecting and configuring an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) on Windows 11 via a USB signal cable, which causes Windows to automatically detect the device and show a battery indicator in the taskbar.

The process is demonstrated with an APC UPS but applies broadly to most USB-connected UPS units.
