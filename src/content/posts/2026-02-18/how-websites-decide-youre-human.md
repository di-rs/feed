Bots account for ~42% of all web traffic with nearly two-thirds being malicious, driving the need for sophisticated multi-layer anti-bot detection in modern applications. Websites classify traffic into friendly bots (crawlers), ambiguous bots (price scrapers), and clearly malicious bots (credential stuffers), using behavioral signals, browser fingerprinting, and risk scoring to distinguish humans from automation. Understanding these mechanisms helps developers evaluate anti-bot solutions, debug false positives, and build stronger defenses.
