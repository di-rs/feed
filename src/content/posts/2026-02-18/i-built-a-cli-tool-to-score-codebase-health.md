What started as a weekend hack to quantify "how bad" an inherited codebase was turned into a production tool used by real engineering teams. The author discovered that codebase health is multidimensional—complexity (15% weight), test coverage, dependency health, and more—and that simple metrics like cyclomatic complexity can be gamed or misleading in isolation. The hardest challenge wasn't building the measurement system but convincing teams to act on scores rather than dismiss them as vanity metrics.
