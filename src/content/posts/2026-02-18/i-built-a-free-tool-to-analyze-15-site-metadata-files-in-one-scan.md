Site Metadata Explorer is a free, no-signup tool that analyzes a website's complete metadata in a single scan — covering meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, robots.txt, sitemaps, JSON-LD structured data, web manifest, and even security.txt/llms.txt. A standout feature is LLM-ready export: scan results can be exported as JSON or Markdown and sent directly to Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini for SEO audits. Built with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and Cheerio; fully open source on GitHub.
