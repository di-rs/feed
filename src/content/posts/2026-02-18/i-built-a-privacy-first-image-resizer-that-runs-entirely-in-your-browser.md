resiz.site is a free batch image resizer that processes up to 50 images entirely client-side using the Canvas API, File API, Blob API, and Web Workers — your photos never leave your device. Built out of frustration with upload-based tools that raise privacy concerns, it supports multiple resize modes including exact dimensions, scale percentage, and more. The project demonstrates how modern browser APIs can replace server-side processing for many common image manipulation tasks.
