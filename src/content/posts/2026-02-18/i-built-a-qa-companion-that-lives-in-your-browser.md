QA Power-Click is a free Chrome extension that generates ready-to-paste test automation code for Playwright, Cypress, Selenium Python/Java, and Robot Framework by clicking any element on any webpage. It uses a scoring engine prioritizing stable selectors (data-testid, aria-label) over fragile CSS classes, and detects 100+ dynamic ID patterns to avoid. The extension also includes a Magic Form Filler that detects 16 field types for rapid manual QA testing.
