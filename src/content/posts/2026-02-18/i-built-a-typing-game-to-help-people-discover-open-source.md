Codakey is a typing game built to help developers discover and engage with open source projects in an era where AI can spin up SaaS products overnight. The author believes open source stands out because of its community — real people building real things together in ways AI-generated tools can't replicate. By combining typing practice with open source exploration, Codakey aims to deepen developer connection to the broader community.
