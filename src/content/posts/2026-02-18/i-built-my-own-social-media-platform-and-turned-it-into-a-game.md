The developer built Hypenote, a community discussion platform where user influence ("Aura") is earned through community upvotes and decreases through downvotes, directly affecting capabilities like pinning posts, creating private circles, and voting weight. The platform incorporates game mechanics like Aura decay over time, streak bonuses, daily post limits, and scarcity-driven behavior to encourage strategic participation over noise. Building it revealed that social platforms are psychology engines — reputation, scarcity, and influence design shape human behavior at a systemic level.
