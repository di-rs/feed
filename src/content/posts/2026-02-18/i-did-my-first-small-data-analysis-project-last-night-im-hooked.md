A developer used 9 years of Google Fit step data (2,084 rows) to run their first Python data analysis project in the terminal, uncovering trends like a 50% median step count drop in 2024 from a leg injury and a slow upward recovery trend. Using an AI assistant for step-by-step guidance (not to do the work outright) made the learning process stick, as the personal relevance of the data made each coding challenge meaningful. Next steps include building a visual dashboard for projections and connecting new smartwatch data.
