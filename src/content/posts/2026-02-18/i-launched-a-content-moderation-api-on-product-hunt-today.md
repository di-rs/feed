ContentGuard is a content moderation API that beats AWS Rekognition on both price ($9/month vs $150/month) and speed (sub-20ms response times). Its standout feature is a customizable severity dial (1-5) letting different applications set different filter thresholds — a children's Minecraft server and an adult gaming community shouldn't use the same rules. The API launched on Product Hunt today with a free tier available for testing.
