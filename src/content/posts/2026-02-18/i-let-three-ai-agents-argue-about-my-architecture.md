The author used Claude Code's experimental Agent Teams feature to spin up three specialized AI agents in parallel — a UX designer, a cloud architect, and a devil's advocate — to design a searchable CNCF certification exam website. In just 3.5 minutes, the agents independently analyzed the CNCF curriculum repo, ran parallel deep dives from their respective angles, and the main agent synthesized a unified design document that was richer than solo analysis could produce. The piece explores practical mechanics of Agent Teams including in-process vs. split-panes display modes, agent navigation, and per-agent token tracking via the CLI.
