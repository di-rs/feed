After sifting through 20+ books on AI and LLM engineering, the author curates 10 practitioner-focused titles written by engineers who've shipped real AI systems in production—not academics or hype writers. The picks consistently surface in Reddit and Hacker News discussions as the most recommended resources for building production-grade LLM applications. The author also notes AI Engineering roles are surging in 2026, with salaries running 10-20% higher than equivalent traditional SWE positions.
