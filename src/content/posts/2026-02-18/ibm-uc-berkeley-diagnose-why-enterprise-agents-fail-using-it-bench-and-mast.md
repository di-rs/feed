IBM Research and UC Berkeley used the ITBench benchmark and MAST taxonomy to study how LLM-based agents fail in real-world IT automation tasks. They found stronger models like Gemini-3-Flash exhibit isolated failure modes, while open-source models show compounding failure patterns. The research distinguishes between "fatal" failures that directly cause task failure and "non-fatal" recoverable flaws, providing actionable insights for building more reliable enterprise AI agents.
