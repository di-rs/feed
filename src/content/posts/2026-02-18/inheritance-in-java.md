A beginner-friendly introduction to inheritance in Java, one of the core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. The article explains how a child class (subclass) inherits properties and methods from a parent class (superclass) using the `extends` keyword, enabling code reuse, method overriding for runtime polymorphism, and easier maintenance. Includes a simple working code example demonstrating parent and child class interaction.
