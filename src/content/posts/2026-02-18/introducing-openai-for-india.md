OpenAI launched "OpenAI for India" at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 in Delhi, partnering with Tata Group to build sovereign AI infrastructure starting with 100MW of data center capacity through TCS's HyperVault. The initiative includes deploying ChatGPT Enterprise to hundreds of thousands of TCS employees — one of the largest enterprise AI rollouts globally — alongside OpenAI Certifications expansion and new offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru. India already has over 100 million weekly ChatGPT users, making it a key market in OpenAI's global Stargate infrastructure push.
