TajikGPT is a full AI platform from Tajikistan featuring a proprietary TJ-series of LLMs (including vision, coding, and video generation models), image and video generation, and a REST API with official Python and Node.js SDKs. The stack is intentionally minimal — built with pure PHP and vanilla JavaScript on flat-file storage, running on shared hosting. Plans range from free (3-hour resets) to $29.99/month for unlimited requests.
