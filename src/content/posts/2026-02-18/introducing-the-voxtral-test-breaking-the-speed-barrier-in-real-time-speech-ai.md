Voxtral is Mistral AI's next-generation open-source speech-to-text model family built for ultra-low latency real-time transcription, featuring the Voxtral Mini 4B Realtime model with sub-200ms latency. It uses a novel streaming architecture and custom causal audio encoder that allows transcription as audio arrives — one of the first open-source solutions matching offline accuracy in real-time. The article explores its use across voice agents, live transcription, and other real-time speech AI applications.
