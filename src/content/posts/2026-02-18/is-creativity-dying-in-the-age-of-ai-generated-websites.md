The author observes a growing homogenization of web design as AI-assisted tools like "VibeCode" produce cookie-cutter layouts and interactions, making many recently launched websites look nearly identical. While AI democratizes development by enabling smaller teams to build faster and at lower cost, over-reliance on AI-generated defaults risks replacing individual creative experimentation with templated "best practices." The challenge is to treat AI as a creative collaborator rather than a template factory, preserving room for genuinely original design.
