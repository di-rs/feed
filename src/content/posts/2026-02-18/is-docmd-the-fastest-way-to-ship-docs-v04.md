docmd v0.4.0 delivers genuine zero-config setup—`docmd init` and `docmd build` produces a static site ready for GitHub Pages or Netlify in minutes, with no configuration file required. Standout features include a browser-based live editor that feels instant (not hot-reload), built-in offline search without Algolia setup, and automatic llms.txt generation for AI tool compatibility. The main limitations are no MDX support and limited theming flexibility, making it ideal for teams who prioritize simplicity over React component integration in their docs.
