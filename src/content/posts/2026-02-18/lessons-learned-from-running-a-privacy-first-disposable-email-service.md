The author shares lessons from running Nullmail.cc—a privacy-first disposable email service built on SvelteKit, Vercel, Supabase, and forwardemail.net—after their domain was unexpectedly flagged for abuse by Cloudflare. The incident triggered DNS checks, WHOIS lookups, and negotiations with the .store domain registry, revealing how disposable email domains often trigger automated abuse systems. The service's minimal free-tier architecture enabled a transparent recovery while keeping user privacy intact.
