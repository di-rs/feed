A step-by-step guide to setting up a local cloud development environment using Amazon Q Developer (free tier), WSL with Ubuntu, and MCP Server for application modernization workflows on Windows. Amazon Q integrates directly into VS Code offering natural language Q&A, code generation, and AWS documentation search — authenticated via a free AWS Builder ID. The guide also covers WSL+Ubuntu setup as a lightweight Linux environment for cloud-native scripting and development without dual-booting.
