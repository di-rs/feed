This beginner guide explains how to use json-server to simulate a local REST API and make GET and POST requests in React using the Fetch API. Key patterns include wrapping fetch calls in useEffect, managing loading state with useState, and sending POST requests with proper Content-Type headers and JSON.stringify(). The guide also covers common mistakes like forgetting Content-Type headers and not handling loading states for better UX.
