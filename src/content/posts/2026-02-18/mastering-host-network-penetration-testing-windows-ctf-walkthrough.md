A hands-on walkthrough of a Windows-focused CTF challenge centered on host and network penetration testing, covering reconnaissance with Nmap, and brute-force attacks against a Microsoft IIS server using Hydra with a weak password hint. The author documents how they used Dirb for directory scanning after cracking credentials to locate flags, as part of an ongoing series documenting a pentester's skill-building journey through practical labs.
