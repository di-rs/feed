The article explores how .NET developers can use Model Context Protocol (MCP) to build AI agents with real capabilities like scheduling, calendar workflows, and data access. Using packages like `ModelContextProtocol` and `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`, developers can connect MCP servers to agents instead of manually wiring each API integration. This leads to faster development and cleaner architecture — new features come from adding MCP tools rather than writing custom glue code.
