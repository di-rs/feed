A compact single-file Logo turtle graphics interpreter built in ~100 lines of pure JavaScript, featuring a tokenizer, parser, and AST executor drawn on an HTML5 canvas. It supports the classic `forward`, `left`, `right`, and `repeat` commands plus a bonus `color_cycle` instruction that cycles through 36 HSV hues. No dependencies needed — just save one HTML file and open it in any modern browser.
