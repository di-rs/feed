The article explores "Neural Bicameral LoRA," a concept for decoupling logic and style in AI models, critiquing the current dominance of generalist LLMs like GPT, Gemini, and Claude that know a little about everything but aren't true specialists. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques are proposed as a path toward more modular, specialized AI systems that separate reasoning from stylistic output. The approach challenges the "bigger generalist" paradigm by advocating for targeted fine-tuning that isolates specific capabilities.
