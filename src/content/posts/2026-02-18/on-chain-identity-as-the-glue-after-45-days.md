After 45 days exploring Web3 concepts — DeFi, stablecoins, ZK proofs, and DePIN — the author reframes on-chain identity (ENS, soulbound tokens, attestations) not as a standalone feature but as the critical trust and reputation layer tying everything together. Identity enables under-collateralized DeFi lending via verifiable reputation, privacy-preserving compliance through ZK proofs, and spam/fraud prevention in DePIN networks by tying hardware operators' staked tokens to their on-chain track record. Combined with ZK proofs, on-chain identity allows bringing real-world trust into decentralized systems without sacrificing privacy or requiring centralized KYC.
