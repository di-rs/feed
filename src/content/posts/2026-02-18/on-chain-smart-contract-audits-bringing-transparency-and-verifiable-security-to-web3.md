KtzchenWeb3 introduces an on-chain smart contract audit tool that replaces unverifiable PDF reports with permanently recorded blockchain certificates and immutable security scores (A–F). The tool supports major EVM networks (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, etc.) and integrates industry-standard analyzers including Slither, Mythril, Echidna, and Manticore for deep vulnerability detection. The goal is to shift Web3 security from "trust us" to "verify it yourself" with publicly auditable records.
