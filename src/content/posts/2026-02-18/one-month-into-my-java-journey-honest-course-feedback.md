A personal account from a final-year CS student who started a Full Stack Development course at Payilagam after feeling underprepared despite four years of college. After just one month studying Core Java with trainer Nantha Kumar, the author gained confidence through beginner-friendly teaching, mock interviews, and a blog-writing habit that deepened understanding. An honest and encouraging reflection on starting from zero and why beginning is what matters most.
