Gradio 6's new `gr.HTML` feature supports custom templates, scoped CSS, and JavaScript interactivity, enabling LLMs like Claude to generate complete web applications—frontend, backend, and state management—in a single Python file. The team tested this by building productivity apps, kanban boards with drag-and-drop, and ML demos, all deployable to Hugging Face Spaces with no build step. This "vibe coding" approach dramatically lowers the barrier to full-stack web development for ML practitioners.
