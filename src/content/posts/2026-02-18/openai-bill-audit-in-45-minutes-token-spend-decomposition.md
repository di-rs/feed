A structured 45-minute framework for auditing OpenAI API spending by breaking token costs into four buckets: base generation, context bloat, retries/timeouts, and tool/agent loops. The key shift is measuring cost per successful task rather than cost per request, which reveals the true inefficiency drivers. Identifying which bucket dominates your spend tells you exactly what to optimize first.
