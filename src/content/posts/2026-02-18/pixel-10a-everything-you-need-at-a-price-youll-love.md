Google announces the Pixel 10a at $499 with advanced AI tools, a 48MP main camera, IP68 water resistance, and over 30 hours of battery life. Satellite SOS comes to the A-series for the first time, and the phone is made with the most recycled materials of any A-series Pixel yet. It ships in four colors with seven years of OS, security, and Pixel Drops support.
