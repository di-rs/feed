A practical workflow for using LLMs to transform rough PRDs or Slack threads into clarified requirements, scoped implementation plans, and task breakdowns ready for Jira/Linear/GitHub. The key is providing raw inputs (PRD, platform, constraints, system context) and using structured prompts that force the model to extract requirements, list assumptions, and ask clarifying questions before generating tasks. Treating AI as a planning assistant rather than an oracle significantly reduces mid-sprint surprises and ambiguous requirements.
