Using U.S. v. Heppner as a case study, the article debunks the legal misconception that documents must be "privileged when created" to become privileged when sent to counsel — drawing parallels to how engineers think about confidentiality at the point of transmission.

The framing offers a clearer technical analogy for understanding how attorney-client privilege actually attaches.
