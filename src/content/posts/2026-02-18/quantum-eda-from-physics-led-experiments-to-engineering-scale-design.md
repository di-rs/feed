Quantum EDA (Electronic Design Automation) aims to bring the same structured, repeatable engineering discipline to quantum hardware that classical EDA brought to semiconductor design, without abstracting away the underlying physics. Unlike classical EDA, it must simultaneously model device physics, electromagnetic circuit effects, cryogenic operation, and system-level coherence and noise. Without this transition, scaling quantum systems beyond small demonstrators will remain fragile, inconsistent, and high-risk.
