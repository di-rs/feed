Rizm is a lightweight, self-hosted alternative to Jira and Confluence built with a Rust backend and React + TypeScript frontend, deployable via Docker in minutes. It avoids vendor lock-in and the risk of EOL or breaking UI changes by keeping the entire stack under the team's control, with the frontend planned to be open-source for direct UI customization. This makes it ideal for teams frustrated by the growing complexity and instability of cloud-based project management tools.
