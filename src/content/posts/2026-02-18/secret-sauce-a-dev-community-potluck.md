A community discussion post inviting developers to share the resources that most influenced their careers, with the author kicking things off with their own list including Syntax.fm, ShopTalk Show, Traversy Media, Fireship, freeCodeCamp, and MDN Web Docs. The post distinguishes between college-era learning resources and what the author relies on today, highlighting that some staples like Syntax and Traversy Media have remained consistently valuable. Readers are invited to share their own go-to newsletters, podcasts, repos, and YouTube channels in the comments.
