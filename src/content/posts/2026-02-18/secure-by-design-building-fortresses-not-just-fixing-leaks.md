Secure by Design (SbD) shifts security from a reactive afterthought to an intrinsic part of system architecture — bringing security experts to the whiteboard before the first line of code is written. Its three pillars are threat modeling (identify attack vectors early), attack surface minimization (less to defend = more secure), and secure defaults (encryption and MFA on by default). Fixing security flaws at design time is 30–100x cheaper than patching production systems, making SbD both a safety and a business imperative.
