SoundBoardio turns any public GitHub repository into a shareable, PWA-ready soundboard — no backend, no SaaS lock-in, just a repo with audio files and a `soundboardio.json` config. The project was born from a late-night Discord call where nobody could quickly find a movie quote MP3, leading to the insight that soundboards are essentially versioned audio collections that belong in source control. Using GitHub as the CMS gives you free hosting, forkability, and instant publishing via `git push`.
