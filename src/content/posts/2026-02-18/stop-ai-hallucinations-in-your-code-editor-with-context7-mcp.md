Context7 MCP Server solves the problem of AI coding assistants generating outdated or non-existent APIs by injecting real-time, version-specific library documentation directly into tools like Cursor, Claude Desktop, and VS Code. It supports over 9,000 libraries including React, Next.js, Vue, and Django, and integrates via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a single npx command. Developed by Upstash, it offers a free tier with no API key required.
