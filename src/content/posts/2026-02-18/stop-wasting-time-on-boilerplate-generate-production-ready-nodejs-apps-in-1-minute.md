nodejs-quickstart-structure is a CLI tool that generates a professional, production-ready Node.js project in seconds, supporting both MVC and Clean Architecture patterns with TypeScript or JavaScript. It auto-configures database connections (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL), Redis caching, Kafka for microservices, and generates Docker and GitHub Actions CI/CD templates. The goal is to eliminate "boilerplate fatigue" so developers can start writing business logic immediately.
