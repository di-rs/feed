SuperLocalMemory v2.7 introduces adaptive learning that observes which memories you actually use and re-ranks search results to surface the most contextually relevant content first—solving the noise problem that emerges when AI memory stores scale to thousands of entries. All learning runs on a three-layer local ML architecture with no cloud dependency, no telemetry, and no data leaving your machine. This tackles the fundamental scaling challenge where raw storage and retrieval systems degrade in usefulness at high volume.
