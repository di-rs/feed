A practical reference guide covering essential Linux commands for gathering system information including user identity, hostname, processes, network configuration, and directory structure. Most tools come pre-installed and are critical not just for routine Linux administration but also for security assessments and identifying vulnerabilities. Commands like whoami, id, and hostname form the foundation of understanding any Linux system's structure and configuration.
