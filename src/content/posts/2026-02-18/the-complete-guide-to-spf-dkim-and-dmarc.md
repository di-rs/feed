Email authentication is critical for preventing domain spoofing and phishing attacks, which cost organizations billions annually through business email compromise. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are three complementary DNS-based protocols that work together — SPF declares which mail servers can send on your behalf, DKIM adds cryptographic signatures to messages, and DMARC defines the policy for handling authentication failures. Implementing all three protects your domain's reputation, prevents spoofing, and ensures better deliverability across providers like Gmail, Microsoft, and Yahoo.
