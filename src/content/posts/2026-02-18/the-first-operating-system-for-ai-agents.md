AIPass describes deploying three brand-new AI agent teams into a 30-branch, 14-system ecosystem with zero training—and watching them begin collaborating, building, and using every available system service within hours. The key insight is that agents need persistent identity, structured state, and rich tooling ecosystems more than better memory or recall alone. The post frames this as the architecture of the first true "operating system" for AI agents, contrasting it with the limitations of RAG pipelines and long-context windows.
