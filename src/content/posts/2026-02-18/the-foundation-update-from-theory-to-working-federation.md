The Foundation — a tool for capturing and searching Claude conversations — has evolved from clipboard-scraping hacks to a real ActivityPub server. It now uses Claude's internal API to auto-capture full conversations (including artifacts), implements passage-level search with scroll-to-highlight, and is discoverable on Mastodon via working ActivityPub federation. The author also stripped out fragile security-scanning code, making the codebase smaller and more reliable.
