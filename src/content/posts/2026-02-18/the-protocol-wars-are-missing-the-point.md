While AI companies race to define agent communication standards — Anthropic's MCP, Google's A2A, and OpenAI's Agents SDK — they all share a critical blind spot: humans are not first-class participants in any of these protocols. The author argues that the hardest problem isn't AI-to-AI communication but designing reliable AI-to-human handoffs, with research showing 67% of failed AI implementations cite poor handoff design and that LLMs are confidently wrong 31% of the time without confidence-based human routing. The piece proposes "human-aware protocols" with preserved context across the human boundary, standardized uncertainty signaling, and audit trails required by regulations like the EU AI Act.
