LogRocket's weekly newsletter for dev leaders covers recreating Claude Skills in GitHub Copilot using scoped instruction files, why developer platforms fail when treated as factories, and a Cloudflare-dependent stack security playbook. Also included: Steve Yegge on the "Dracula effect" of vibe coding and the hidden cognitive debt cost of AI-generated code — a solid roundup of the key conversations in frontend dev and AI tooling this week.
