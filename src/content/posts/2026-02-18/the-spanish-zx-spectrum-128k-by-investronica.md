Investrónica (a subsidiary of El Corte Inglés) designed and released the Spanish ZX Spectrum +128K in 1985, including a numeric keypad and full Spanish language support (including 'ñ') to comply with local law — predating the official English Sinclair release by a year. Sinclair UK ultimately discarded the keypad and advanced BASIC editing features in their final Spectrum +128K, taking only the screen menu concept from the Spanish design. The Spanish machine is a significant but often overlooked piece of computing history, showing how localization requirements drove hardware innovation.
