MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers transform Cursor from a smart code editor into a real network operations assistant by bridging it directly to live infrastructure — querying inventory, triggering automation, and pulling monitoring data. The article targets enterprise and telecom-scale environments where engineers work across Cisco, Juniper, Nokia, and Huawei platforms simultaneously, making context-switching the primary pain point. Connecting Cursor to MCP servers creates a unified coordination layer that reduces fragmentation and shortens troubleshooting cycles.
