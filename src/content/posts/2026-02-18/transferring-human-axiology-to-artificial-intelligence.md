This article explores the core challenge of AI alignment: bridging the ontological gap between code syntax and the semantics of human values. It examines coherent extrapolated volition (CEV), Bostrom's orthogonality thesis, and the risks of treacherous turns and paperclip-style misalignment. The author argues that direct norm specification is insufficient and that ontological crises emerge as autonomous systems evolve — making "sovereign sense" design a critical consideration for safe AI.
