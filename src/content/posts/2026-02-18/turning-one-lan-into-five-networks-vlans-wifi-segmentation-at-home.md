Part 2 of a homelab rebuild series documenting how to segment a home network into five VLANs using a GL.iNet Brume 2 router (OpenWrt), a managed Netgear switch, and an Omada access point with SSIDs mapped to VLAN IDs. Each VLAN serves a distinct purpose such as IoT isolation, trusted devices, and guest access, with proper inter-VLAN routing rules enforced. Part 3 will cover connecting two physical lab locations via a routed WireGuard tunnel.
