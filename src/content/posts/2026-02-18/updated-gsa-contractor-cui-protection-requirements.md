The GSA has updated cybersecurity requirements for contractors handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), upgrading the baseline from NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 to Rev 3 and adding controls from NIST SP 800-172 and 800-53. The new framework introduces quarterly vulnerability scans, annual penetration tests, third-party assessments every three years, defined "showstopper" controls required for contract approval, and a mandatory one-hour incident reporting window. Contractors serving both GSA and DoD must carefully manage the differences between Revision 2 (DoD) and Revision 3 (GSA) requirements simultaneously.
