After 200+ generations and systematic testing, the author reveals that Veo 3.1 responds far more predictably to structured JSON prompts than natural language descriptions — replacing vague adjectives like "cinematic" with explicit schema fields for camera type, movement speed, lighting, and atmosphere. The JSON schema acts as a pseudo-API for the model, eliminating the ambiguity that causes inconsistent output across runs. This approach shifts creativity from word-choice to structured parameter design.
