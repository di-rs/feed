A developer reflects on production incidents—a Lambda timeout from uncontrolled DynamoDB parallelism and a stateful Docker container breaking consistency in cloud deployments—as inspiration for building "Dev Sentinel" with Claude Code. The key insight is that many engineering lessons go unrecorded, lost to memory rather than converted into institutional knowledge or future intuition. Dev Sentinel aims to systematically capture failures so teams can learn from them and improve over time.
