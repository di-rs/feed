Evaluating fine-tuned LLMs for business use requires combining automated metrics—like BLEU scores, perplexity, and factual accuracy—with human judgment to assess both technical performance and real-world utility. Factual accuracy, measured by comparing generated output against verified data sources on a 0-to-1 scale, is especially critical since incorrect product details or company policies can damage customer trust and create legal risk. Teams must select the right combination of metrics based on their specific business goals rather than relying on any single measurement approach.
