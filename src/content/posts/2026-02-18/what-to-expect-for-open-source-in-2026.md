GitHub's Octoverse 2025 data reveals open source is becoming increasingly global, with 36 million new developers joining in 2025—including 5.2 million from India alone—fundamentally shifting how projects must operate. This growth means contributors increasingly don't share work hours, cultural expectations, or even languages, forcing maintainers to rethink collaboration models. The report also covers AI-assisted development trends, TypeScript's rise to the #1 language, and what's needed for sustainable open source in 2026.
