ROLLIN is a public REST API covering 56,000+ restaurants and venues across 6 US states, replacing Google Maps' single boolean with a detailed 0–100 accessibility score broken down across six physical features (entrance, restroom, level entry, parking, aisle width, elevator). An MCP server companion makes the data queryable directly from AI assistants, filling a gap that leaves 5.5 million US wheelchair users invisible to location-based developers. The data improves over time through user reports and verification.
