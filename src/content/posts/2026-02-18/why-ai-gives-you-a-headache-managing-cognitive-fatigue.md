Heavy AI tool usage is causing real cognitive fatigue — a 2025 study found that deeper GenAI engagement amplifies cognitive burden rather than reducing it. The key culprits are decision fatigue from constant architectural choices (AI speeds up prototyping but increases the frequency of decisions), continuous task initiation burden (you must direct every next action), and prompt fatigue from uncertainty about how to get reliable outputs. The article offers strategies for managing AI-related cognitive load before it leads to burnout.
