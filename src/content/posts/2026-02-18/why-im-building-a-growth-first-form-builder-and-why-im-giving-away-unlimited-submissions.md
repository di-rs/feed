FlowyForm is a new form builder built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS that eliminates the "Success Tax" — the aggressive pricing escalation common in traditional form builders as submission volume grows. The free tier offers unlimited forms and unlimited submissions, removing growth friction for founders and developers. Key differentiators include conditional IF/THEN/ELSE logic, vertical-specific templates, and built-in integrations with Google Sheets, Slack, and Zapier.
