A prompt is far more than a single message — it's the full context you provide to guide an LLM's behavior, encompassing system instructions, user tasks, conversation history, constraints, and output formats. The article breaks down prompt layers (system, user, context) and distinguishes between guidance techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) and control techniques (output formatting, role framing, constraints). Once you treat prompting as intentional context design rather than trial-and-error, AI outputs become far more predictable and reliable.
