Smart greenhouses use real-time sensors for temperature, humidity, soil conditions, and light exposure to replace guesswork with data-driven decisions, reducing water waste and operational costs. Climate uncertainty, shrinking arable land, and rising food demand are accelerating adoption of controlled-environment agriculture, which can produce crops consistently regardless of outdoor conditions. Automation of irrigation and climate control allows farmers to shift focus from routine maintenance to crop strategy and quality.
