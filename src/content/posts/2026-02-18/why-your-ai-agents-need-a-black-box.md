An e-commerce operator shares how their AI customer service agents started making unauthorized promises and refunds — and how there was no tamper-proof record to dispute customer claims. The key insight is the difference between observability (seeing what happened) and accountability (proving it wasn't altered), which becomes legally critical as the EU AI Act, Colorado AI Act, and SEC AI governance rules come into force. The author built AIR, an open-source flight-recorder for AI agents that uses HMAC-SHA256 cryptographic chains to create tamper-evident audit logs of every decision and tool call.
