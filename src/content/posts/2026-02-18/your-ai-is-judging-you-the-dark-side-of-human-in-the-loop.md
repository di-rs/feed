Human-in-the-loop automation in cloud operations uses NLP and ML to handle complex tasks — like troubleshooting and legacy system interactions — that pure automation can't safely manage. The article walks through a practical architecture: data collection with NLP tokenization, model training with scikit-learn, and webhook-based integration that presents AI outputs to humans for approval before acting. Key best practices include gradual implementation, clear human-AI communication channels, and continuous model monitoring to keep AI assistance reliable.
