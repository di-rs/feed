The article showcases five DataFrame operations where using LLMs (via the everyrow library) outperforms traditional code: qualitative filtering, row classification, web research enrichment, and more. With concrete cost estimates and Pydantic-based code examples, it demonstrates how LLMs handle subjective or complex data tasks that regex or SQL simply can't. A practical guide for data engineers looking to augment pandas workflows with AI at reasonable cost.
