This guide walks through 5 O(n) methods to check if a Python tuple is sorted without sorting it, including all()+zip(), for loops, range(), itertools.pairwise() (Python 3.10+), and sorted() comparison. Each approach includes early-exit optimization, making them suitable for large tuples or interview scenarios.
