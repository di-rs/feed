A developer shares a structured 7-day Java coding practice plan that progressively covers number manipulation, recursion, arrays, strings, and linked lists to build a strong problem-solving foundation. Each day introduces new concepts — from basic digit extraction and Fibonacci sequences to bubble sort, two-pointer techniques, and string operations — with analysis of time and space complexity throughout. The plan is designed as a focused interview preparation sprint, emphasizing both iterative and recursive approaches for each category of problem.
