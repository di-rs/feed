Focus Portal is a full-stack productivity app that combines task management, real-time Q&A, rich text editing, and file uploads in a single distraction-free platform. Built with secure email authentication and real-time updates, it showcases practical full-stack skills across frontend, backend, and deployment. The project is open-source with a live demo available.
