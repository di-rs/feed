A structured QA strategy guide for enterprise AI features, tackling the core challenge that AI outputs are probabilistic — not deterministic — and that behavior shifts with prompts, context drift, model updates, and latency constraints. The playbook starts by classifying the AI feature type (text generation, search/ranking, classification, decision support, or agentic workflows) before designing appropriate tests, with an emphasis on trust, safety, auditability, and compliance beyond basic functional correctness.
