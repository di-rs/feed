Despite the title, this is a practical guide to advanced Git commands you only discover after breaking something in production: `git reflog` (recovers any commit from the last 90 days, even after hard resets), named stashes with selective file support, and `git bisect` for automatically isolating which commit introduced a bug. The reflog alone has saved countless developers from catastrophic data loss after accidental resets or bad merges. Essential patterns rarely taught but universally needed.
