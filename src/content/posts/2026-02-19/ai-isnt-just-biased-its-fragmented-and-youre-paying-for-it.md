AI tokenizers silently discriminate based on language: because English dominates training data, English text compresses into far fewer tokens than equivalent text in less common languages. This "tokenization tax" means non-English users pay more per API call, exhaust their context windows faster, and get worse reasoning performance — all for the same service. Open-source tools like Tokka-Bench are now benchmarking these inequalities across 100 languages.
