Stanford's 2025 study of 1,500 workers reveals that 45.2% prefer equal human-AI partnership over full automation, with only 1.9% wanting complete AI control — yet 41% of enterprise AI investments target tasks workers actively resist. The research introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS), a framework for aligning AI integration with actual worker intent rather than automation-first assumptions. For businesses, the real competitive advantage lies in workflow automation that matches human preferences, not replaces them.
