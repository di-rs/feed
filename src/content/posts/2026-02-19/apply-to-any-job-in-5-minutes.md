ApplyIn5 is an AI-powered Chrome extension that auto-fills job application forms, generates ATS-optimized CVs and cover letters tailored to each posting, and answers behavioral questions automatically. Built by a developer frustrated with broken parsers on regional portals like Bayt and Naukri, it supports 100+ job sites and is currently in free beta. Unlike fully autonomous "auto-apply" tools, it keeps the user in control of what data gets submitted.
