A developer built FPVtune, a browser-based tool that automates Betaflight PID tuning by analyzing blackbox logs with a neural network — no install required. The tool parses binary Betaflight logs (handling multiple firmware versions), runs signal and step-response analysis, and outputs optimized PID and filter recommendations from just a 30-second flight.
