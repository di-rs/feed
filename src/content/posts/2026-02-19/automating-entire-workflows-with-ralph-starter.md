ralph-starter is an open-source MIT-licensed CLI that eliminates the manual copy-paste loop between AI coding assistants and the terminal by orchestrating agents in autonomous feedback loops — running the agent, checking tests/lint/build, feeding errors back automatically, and opening a PR when everything passes. It supports Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Openclaw, and more with auto-detection of installed tools. The tool works best with a clear spec and a solid test suite, transforming the AI assistant from a chat partner into a true autonomous coding loop.
