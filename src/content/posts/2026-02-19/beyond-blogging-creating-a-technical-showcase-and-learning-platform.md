Instead of spinning up a standard static blog, the author built a complete content-creation and learning platform that treats posts as evolving artifacts rather than static publications, architected in collaboration with Claude Opus. The platform blurs the line between blogging, technical demonstration, and continuous experimentation — integrating AI tools directly into the ideation-to-distribution workflow. The result is a developer showcase designed to help build better, not just document what's already been built.
