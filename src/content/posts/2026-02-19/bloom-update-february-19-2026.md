Bloom, a privacy-first HRT tracking app, received a focused update improving clarity and user experience. Changes include a rebuilt Help page with guided walkthroughs of every feature, refreshed messaging to better speak to people on HRT journeys, and removal of the PIN lock feature—which was dropped because supporting PIN recovery safely would require accounts or cloud storage, conflicting with the app's core privacy principles. Multi-medication support was also added in this release.
