A step-by-step guide to building a Python desktop application using Tkinter and ttkbootstrap that recursively searches file contents across TXT, CSV, XLSX, PDF, and XML formats. The app supports regex searches, shows live progress with speed and ETA estimates, previews matched content in-app, and can export results to CSV — built on Python 3.9+ with PyPDF2, xlrd, and ttkbootstrap dependencies.
