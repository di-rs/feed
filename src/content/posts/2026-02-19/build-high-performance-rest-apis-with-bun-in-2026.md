Bun has solidified as a serious Node.js alternative for backend development, offering dramatically faster startup times, native HTTP serving via Bun.serve, and built-in SQL/SQLite support — all without a single npm dependency. Written in Zig and powered by the JavaScriptCore engine, Bun eliminates Express-style boilerplate while delivering measurably higher throughput. This guide walks through building a complete Todo REST API using only Bun's native primitives, demonstrating zero-dependency backend development in 2026.
