An open-source Solana Narrative Detector automatically identifies emerging ecosystem trends by aggregating on-chain transaction signals from 16 programs (Jupiter, Orca, Pump.fun, etc.), GitHub activity across 15 Solana orgs, CoinGecko market data, and RSS news feeds — all running every 2 hours. The tool clusters signals into narratives and generates product ideas for each detected trend, solving the information overload problem in fast-moving blockchain ecosystems. Live dashboard and source code are publicly available.
