A role-based student management system built with Rust, egui, and PostgreSQL that extends beyond authentication into full authorization, with dashboards and navigation adapting dynamically based on the authenticated user's role. The app features PostgreSQL-backed CRUD operations for student records, class-based filtering tied to teacher assignments, and permission-controlled editing and deletion. The UI reflects identity, role, and database state rather than static logic, demonstrating Rust's capability for building data-driven desktop applications.
