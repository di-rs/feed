A technical deep-dive into building AI phone agents that integrate bidirectionally with Dentally's API to complete real dental appointment bookings, rescheduling, and cancellations — not just act as voicemail transcription. Key engineering challenges include optimistic locking for concurrent slot availability, fuzzy patient matching by name/DOB/phone, dental-specific intent classification (routine vs. emergency vs. follow-up), and GDPR-enforced data access scoping that keeps clinical notes out of AI reach. The post argues that live booking-system integration is what separates a real AI receptionist from a glorified answering machine.
