VoiceFleet shares production lessons running AI voice agents for Irish small businesses including plumbers, electricians, and dental practices, where voicemail has only a ~5% callback rate in 2026. Key technical challenges include achieving sub-500ms response latency, handling wide Irish accent variation (Dublin, Cork, Galway), and teaching the AI Irish-specific vocabulary like "combi boiler" and "the immersion." One Galway plumber reduced missed calls from 55% to under 5%, recovering ~€2,400/month in jobs for only €50/month in AI costs.
