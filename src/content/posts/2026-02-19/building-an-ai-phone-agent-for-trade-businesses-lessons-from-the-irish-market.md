Tradespeople (plumbers, electricians, HVAC techs) miss 40–60% of calls while physically on the job, so this post details building an AI phone agent that classifies urgency, integrates with calendars, captures job details, and sends SMS summaries. Early deployments showed zero missed calls, 92% caller satisfaction, and €3,000+/month in recovered revenue from converted missed calls. Key lessons favor starting with emergency triage as the highest-value feature, keeping booking flows simple, and preferring SMS over email for trades.
