An AI voice receptionist for dental practices handles appointment booking, emergency triage, insurance queries, and recall campaigns with a strict sub-200ms end-to-end latency requirement for natural conversation. The system integrates with practice management APIs, classifies dental-specific intents (routine check-up vs. treatment follow-up vs. same-day emergency), and enforces GDPR compliance through EU data residency, AES-256 encryption, and scoped access that excludes clinical notes and financials. Dental practices missing 30–40% of inbound calls face €200–€500 in lost patient lifetime value per call, making the ROI case straightforward.
