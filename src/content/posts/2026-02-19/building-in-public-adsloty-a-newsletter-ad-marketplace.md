Adsloty is a self-service marketplace that lets newsletter writers list ad slots and sponsors book them directly—eliminating the manual back-and-forth of email negotiations, pricing discussions, and invoice chasing. The platform handles payments and payouts automatically, and a built-in AI feature analyzes submitted ads for audience fit, tone, and copy clarity before the writer even sees them. Think Calendly meets Gumroad, purpose-built for the growing newsletter ad economy.
