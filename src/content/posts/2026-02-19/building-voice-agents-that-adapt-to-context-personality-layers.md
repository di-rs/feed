The article presents a pattern for building adaptive voice AI assistants using "personality layers" — composable modules that modulate tone, formality, pace, and enthusiasm based on user context without retraining separate models. A single core agent dynamically adjusts output parameters passed to TTS engines, enabling context-aware voice for customer support, education, and enterprise scenarios. The approach uses Claude to generate both the text response and personality metadata in a single pass.
