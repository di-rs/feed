The Four Burner Theory says you must sacrifice some life areas (family, friends, health, work) to succeed, but AI may break that constraint by eliminating entire categories of cognitive effort rather than just compressing time. When mental energy is freed up by AI handling routine cognitive tasks, it can be redirected to any life area—not just work. The author argues AI is the first technology that genuinely changes the math of life's fundamental tradeoffs.
