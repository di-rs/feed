A developer built Capo2Keys, a tool that converts guitar chord charts (with capo positions) into piano-friendly transpositions, solving the tedious manual process of transposing chord sheets with lyrics. Frustrated by ChatGPT's copyright limitations blocking song lyric transposition, the developer AI-assisted the build to automate chord conversion and PDF generation. The project is a great example of using AI as a coding partner to solve niche personal workflow problems.
