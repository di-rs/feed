Anthropic released Claude Sonnet 4.6 just 12 days after Opus 4.6, delivering flagship-level performance at 1/5 the price ($3/$15 vs $15/$75 per million tokens). Developers with early access prefer Sonnet 4.6 over both Sonnet 4.5 and the previous Opus 4.5, and computer use success rates jumped from ~35% to ~55% on the OSWorld benchmark. If you're running Opus in production, migrating to Sonnet 4.6 likely saves 80% on API costs with no quality tradeoff.
