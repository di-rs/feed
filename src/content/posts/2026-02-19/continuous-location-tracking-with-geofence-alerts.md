A practical implementation guide for continuous location tracking with custom geofence alerts on HarmonyOS wearable apps using the `@ohos.geoLocationManager` API. It walks through runtime permission handling, subscribing to continuous location updates, and building a custom circular geofence with entry/exit detection — with a reminder that location updates consume significant battery and should only run when needed.
