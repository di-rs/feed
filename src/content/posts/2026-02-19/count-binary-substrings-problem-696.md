LeetCode 696 asks you to count binary substrings where 0s and 1s are equal in count and grouped consecutively — the key insight is that the answer for any two adjacent groups is simply `min(group1_size, group2_size)`. The guide covers this linear group-counting approach with solutions in C++, Python, and JavaScript.
