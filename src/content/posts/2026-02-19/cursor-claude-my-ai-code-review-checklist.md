A developer shares their battle-tested workflow using Cursor and Claude for AI-assisted code review, focusing on reviewing diffs rather than whole files to prevent hallucinations. Key practices include a structured prompt template forcing Claude to identify high-risk bugs, edge cases, and missing test cases, plus a local CI script as a merge gate for types, lint, tests, and secret scanning. This practical checklist helps solo SaaS developers ship fewer regressions with receipts.
