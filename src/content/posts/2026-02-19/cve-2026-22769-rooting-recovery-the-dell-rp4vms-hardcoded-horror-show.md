CVE-2026-22769 (CVSS 10.0 Critical) exposes that Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines shipped with hardcoded admin credentials in its Apache Tomcat Manager configuration. China-nexus threat group UNC6201 exploited this zero-day for nearly two years, deploying SLAYSTYLE web shells and BRICKSTORM backdoors to gain full root access and lateral movement capabilities. Affected users must immediately patch to version 6.0.3.1 HF1 and restrict network access to ports 8082 and 443.
