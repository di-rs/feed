Day 7 of an AWS learning series covers Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using AWS CloudFormation to deploy a VPC baseline with cross-stack references. The tutorial deploys two stacks — a network stack (VPC, subnets, IGW) and an app stack (EC2, security groups) — using YAML templates and exported values between stacks. This practical walkthrough demonstrates how CloudFormation enables reproducible, version-controlled AWS infrastructure.
