A fresh 2026 practical comparison of four durable workflow engine approaches in Python: Temporal (battle-tested distributed platform used at Stripe and DoorDash), DBOS Transact (lightweight Postgres-backed durability), Prefect 3.x (Pythonic open-source orchestration), and a custom Python engine. Each offers different tradeoffs in reliability, infrastructure overhead, and ease of adoption depending on your workload.
