Traditional trial flows requiring registration and email keys lose 30-40% of potential users before they try your software—embedded trial keys solve this by pre-shipping an evaluation license directly in the binary. Users download and run your app immediately with 100% trial start rates, validated locally without server round-trips. Using QLM License Manager in .NET, this technique is straightforward to implement and dramatically improves the evaluation experience.
