Inspired by Martin Fowler's classic article on Feature Toggles, this guide explains how feature flags decouple code deployment from feature releases — letting teams push code to production with features disabled and activate them selectively when ready. The article categorizes toggles by longevity and dynamism: Release Toggles (short-lived, for coordinated launches), Experiment Toggles (A/B testing, medium-term), and others, with practical Python/FastAPI implementation examples. It's a solid introduction to eliminating deploy anxiety and enabling safer, more controlled rollouts.
