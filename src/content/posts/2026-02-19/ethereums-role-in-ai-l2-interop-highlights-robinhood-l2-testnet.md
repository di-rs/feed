Vitalik Buterin reframed Ethereum's role in AI as a privacy-preserving coordination layer — enabling trustless LLM interactions, zero-knowledge API payments, and on-chain dispute resolution rather than simply accelerating AGI. This week's digest also covers L2 Interoperability Working Group highlights around EIP-7702 cross-chain UX, Robinhood's public L2 testnet launch, and OWASP's 2026 smart contract vulnerability forecasts. The convergence of AI and blockchain infrastructure is becoming a serious development frontier.
