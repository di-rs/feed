This article breaks down a clean, event-driven Hangman game built entirely with native Node.js modules—readline, fs, and EventEmitter—without any external NPM dependencies. The architecture centers on a Hangman class that extends EventEmitter, elegantly decoupling game state management from the interactive CLI prompts. It's a practical showcase of object-oriented design and CLI application patterns in vanilla JavaScript.
