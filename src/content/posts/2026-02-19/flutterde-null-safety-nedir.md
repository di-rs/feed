A Turkish-language introduction to Flutter's Null Safety system, explaining how it eliminates null reference errors at compile time by differentiating nullable types (String?) from non-nullable types (String). The post covers key operators including null-aware access (?.), null coalescing (??), and null assertion (!) with concise code examples, summarizing how Null Safety makes Flutter apps more reliable by catching potential null errors during development rather than at runtime.
