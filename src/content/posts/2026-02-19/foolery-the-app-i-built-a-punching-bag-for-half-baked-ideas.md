Foolery is a free, open-source tool built for developers lost across dozens of tmux panes, orphaned git worktrees, and fragmented AI conversations — acting as an issue organizer, LLM multiplexer, and workflow visualizer all in one. It's designed to tame the cognitive chaos of multi-context development work and the context-blowing micro-thrashing that derails focus. Unlike TUIs, Foolery keeps things approachable without adding yet another heavy interface to manage.
