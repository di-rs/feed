Google has released Gemini 3.1 Pro, a significant upgrade to their core AI model featuring improved reasoning with a 77.1% score on ARC-AGI-2 — more than double Gemini 3 Pro's performance. The model is rolling out across the Gemini API, Vertex AI, Gemini app, and NotebookLM for developers, enterprises, and consumers. It's designed for complex tasks requiring advanced reasoning including code-based animation, data synthesis, and multi-step problem solving.
