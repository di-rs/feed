Azure VM Scale Sets let you deploy and manage a group of identical VMs that automatically scale in or out based on demand, providing high availability across fault domains without manual pre-provisioning. You configure key options like orchestration mode (Uniform vs Flexible), VM image, architecture (x64 or Arm64), and size directly in the Azure portal to match your workload requirements.
