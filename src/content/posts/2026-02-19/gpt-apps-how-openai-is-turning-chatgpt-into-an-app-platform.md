OpenAI opened the ChatGPT App Directory to public submissions in late 2025, allowing developers to build interactive UIs that run natively inside ChatGPT conversations with 800+ million users. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), GPT Apps support embedded widgets, state persistence across sessions, and a clean `window.openai` API — a notable advantage over standard MCP Apps. If you've already built MCP tools, you're closer than you think to shipping a production-ready GPT App.
