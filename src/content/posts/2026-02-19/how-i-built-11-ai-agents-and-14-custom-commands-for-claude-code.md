A developer spent two months customizing Claude Code into a specialized development environment with 11 domain-specific AI agents (architecture, security, performance), 14 custom slash commands, and real-time usage tracking. A CLAUDE.md onboarding doc combined with a Ghostty + tmux terminal setup lets Claude understand the full project context (Next.js 15, Supabase, TypeScript strict mode) from the very first message. The result eliminates repetitive context-setting and dramatically improves AI-assisted development flow across 42,000+ messages.
