The author built a browser-based Sudoku platform using plain JavaScript with minimal abstractions, prioritizing fast DOM manipulation over heavy frameworks to keep gameplay responsive on both desktop and mobile. The puzzle generator follows a three-step process: create a fully solved grid, carefully remove numbers, and verify uniqueness and difficulty — balancing randomness with logical solvability. The result includes instant puzzle generation, an integrated solver, printable sheet support, and zero installation required.
