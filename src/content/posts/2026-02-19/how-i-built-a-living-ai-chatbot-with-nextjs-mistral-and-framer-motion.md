A developer walkthrough of building an animated robot-faced AI fitness coach in Next.js powered by Mistral AI, featuring cursor-tracking eyes that calculate offset using trigonometry bounded to a 4px max range via useEffect mouse listeners. Additional personality features include randomized double-blinks to mimic biological behavior, a glassmorphism/neon UI aesthetic, and Framer Motion animations — all designed to make the bot feel "alive" before the user even starts typing.
