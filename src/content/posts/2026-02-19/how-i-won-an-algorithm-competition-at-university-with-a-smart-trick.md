A developer shares how they won a university algorithm competition by thinking carefully about constraints before writing a single line of code. The key puzzle involved designing two cubes with digits to display all numbers from 0 to n — solved through strategic analysis rather than brute-force iteration. The article emphasizes that competitive programming success often comes down to problem decomposition and creative thinking over raw coding speed.
