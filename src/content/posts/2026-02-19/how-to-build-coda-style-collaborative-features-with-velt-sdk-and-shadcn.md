A tutorial on building Coda-style real-time collaborative features using Next.js, Velt SDK, Zustand, and Shadcn UI, without having to build WebSocket infrastructure from scratch. Velt handles connection management, state synchronization, and presence indicators so developers can focus on product logic. The guide covers full project setup through a functional collaborative document editor with cursor presence and live comments.
