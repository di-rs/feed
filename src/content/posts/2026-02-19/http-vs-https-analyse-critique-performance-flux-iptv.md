A deep technical analysis of how HTTP vs HTTPS affects IPTV and OTT streaming performance, focusing on the engineering battle against congestion, fragmentation, and sub-optimal routing. Modern streaming services relying on HLS or DASH over TCP/HTTP face significant overhead from TCP's three-way handshake and congestion control (CUBIC, BBR), which can degrade quality even at packet loss rates above 1%. The article explores why minimizing latency and jitter is fundamentally different from file download optimization, and how transport layer choices shape the user's streaming experience.
