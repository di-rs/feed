A dataset of 153,522 tech layoffs across 35 major companies (Jan 2025 – Feb 2026) reveals that AI automation was a contributing factor in nearly half of all cuts: 14% explicitly AI-driven, 32% partially attributed to it, and 54% unrelated. Rather than jobs disappearing entirely, the data shows a transition — legacy roles are shrinking while ML Engineers and Cloud Security Engineers are being hired at near-$200k salaries.
