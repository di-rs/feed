A developer built a fully automated content pipeline on a Synology NAS that generates tutorial content daily via Python, rebuilds a static Astro site inside Docker, and restarts Nginx — all without manual intervention. The zero-downtime setup acts as a mini CI/CD pipeline running on home hardware, keeping the old site live until the container swap completes. The author describes it as a practical exercise in automation and self-maintaining content systems.
