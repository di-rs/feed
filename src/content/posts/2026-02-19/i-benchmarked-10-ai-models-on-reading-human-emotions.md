Ten AI models were tested on identifying emotions in four movie stills of increasing ambiguity using the OpenMark benchmarking platform, with gpt-5.2 and gemini-3-pro tying at 75% accuracy while most others scored around 50%. The experiment exposes how standard leaderboards often misrepresent real-world task performance, and how significant cost-per-task differences exist even among models with similar accuracy scores.
