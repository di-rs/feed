XComposeMediaPlayer is an open-source Android library that wraps ExoPlayer into a clean, Compose-native API — reducing typical video player setup from 200+ lines of boilerplate to just 5 lines of composable code. It automatically handles lifecycle management, HLS adaptive streaming, track selection, bandwidth metering, wake lock, and playback state, making video integration in Jetpack Compose apps dramatically simpler.
