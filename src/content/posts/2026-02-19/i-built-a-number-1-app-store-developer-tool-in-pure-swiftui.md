Devly is a native macOS menu bar app with 50+ developer utilities (JSON formatter, color converter, regex tester, hashing tools, etc.) built entirely in SwiftUI that reached #1 in Developer Tools on the App Store. The author shares hard-won lessons around Apple's App Sandbox compliance, achieving a truly native menu bar UI, managing state across 50+ tools with a `ToolProtocol` pattern, and building discoverability into a large feature set.
