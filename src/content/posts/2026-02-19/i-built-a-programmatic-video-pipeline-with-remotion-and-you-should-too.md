Remotion lets you build video compositions entirely in React — defining scenes as components, using `useCurrentFrame()` and spring physics for animation, then rendering to MP4 via CLI. The author used it to programmatically generate animated LinkedIn post cards and a 1080p homepage hero video with particles and cycling keywords, replacing hours of After Effects work with reusable, data-driven React code.
