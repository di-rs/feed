India's IT Rules Amendment 2026 requires platforms to remove illegal deepfakes within 3 hours of a government order, but ignores a critical gap — there's no way to prove an AI system actually refused to generate harmful content it claims to have blocked. The article introduces CAP-SRP (Content/Creative AI Profile – Safe Refusal Provenance), a cryptographic framework using hash chains, Ed25519 signing, and Merkle trees to produce verifiable proof of AI refusals. This addresses a regulatory blind spot that will matter as governments increasingly demand accountability from AI platforms.
