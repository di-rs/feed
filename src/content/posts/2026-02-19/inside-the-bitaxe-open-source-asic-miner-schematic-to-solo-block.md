The Bitaxe is a fully open-source Bitcoin ASIC miner using a reverse-engineered Bitmain BM1370 chip and an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, with all schematics, PCB layouts, and firmware publicly available. At 1.2 TH/s pulling just 18 watts from USB-C, it's less a mining powerhouse and more a remarkable hardware-hacking showcase — the same chip found in industrial Antminer S21 Pros, running on a credit-card-sized board anyone can build.
