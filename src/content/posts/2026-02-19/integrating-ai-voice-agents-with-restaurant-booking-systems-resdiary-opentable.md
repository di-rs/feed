VoiceFleet details integrating AI voice agents with restaurant booking platforms including ResDiary, OpenTable, and legacy POS systems using a unified BookingProvider adapter pattern that abstracts platform differences behind a common interface. Key technical challenges include OAuth rate limits during Friday peak hours, handling concurrent reservation requests with optimistic locking, and falling back to Google Calendar for restaurants using paper diaries. The post covers why restaurants miss 20–30% of calls during service and how AI phone answering addresses the classic scheduling conflict of the phone ringing hardest when staff are busiest.
