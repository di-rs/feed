A comprehensive guide to Java Stream intermediate operations including filter(), map(), sorted(), distinct(), and more, explaining their key characteristic of lazy evaluation — they only execute when a terminal operation triggers the pipeline. Intermediate operations transform a stream into another stream and can be chained together to build expressive, efficient data processing pipelines without intermediate collection allocations. Understanding laziness and chaining is essential for writing clean, performant Java code that takes full advantage of the Streams API introduced in Java 8.
