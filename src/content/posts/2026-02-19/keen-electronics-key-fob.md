A hobbyist teardown of a vintage Keen Electronics 433.92 MHz RF key fob, exploring its internal hardware including an SAW resonator with frequency drift, PCB markings, and LED strobe behavior tied to the RF signal. The device — from a now-dissolved UK company — still functions despite severely degraded rubber buttons, offering a window into early consumer RF transmitter design and 12V NM21/23 battery tech.
