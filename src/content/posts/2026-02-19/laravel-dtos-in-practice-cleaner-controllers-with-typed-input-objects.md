Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) in Laravel act as typed input contracts that consolidate validation rules, field definitions, and data normalization in one reusable place, replacing scattered validation arrays across controllers. As projects scale with multiple endpoints and API surfaces, DTOs eliminate duplicated validation, hidden data shapes, and transformation logic spread across files, reducing refactor friction significantly. The post demonstrates practical DTO implementation patterns that keep controllers thin and consistent as Laravel applications grow.
