This deep-dive examines OpenClaw's engineering decisions—one of the fastest-growing open-source projects ever—to extract actionable patterns for AI agent builders. The author covers the 4-layer gateway architecture, the Lane Queue reliability system, skills-as-markdown extensibility, human-readable file-based memory, and CVE-derived security lessons. It culminates in 10 concrete patterns developers can directly adopt when building their own persistent, multi-channel agent systems.
