Lingo Bolt is a web app and GitHub bot that breaks down language barriers in open source by auto-translating issues and comments, and generating multilingual onboarding documentation using RAG over the codebase. It aims to help contributors who struggle with English and maintainers overwhelmed by non-English issues, making open source truly accessible to a global developer community.
