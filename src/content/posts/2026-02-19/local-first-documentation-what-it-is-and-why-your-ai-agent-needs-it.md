Local-first documentation indexes library docs into a local database for AI coding assistants, eliminating cloud dependency and enabling sub-10ms lookups instead of 100–500ms cloud round-trips. When cloud documentation services hit rate limits, AI agents fall back to outdated training data and start hallucinating deprecated APIs — local-first solves this by keeping docs on your machine, version-locked and offline-ready. Tools like DevDocs, Zeal, and Dash have offered offline docs for developers for years; applying this architecture to AI agents is the natural next step.
