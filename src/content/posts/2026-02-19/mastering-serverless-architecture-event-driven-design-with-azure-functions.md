A deep technical dive into building production-grade event-driven systems using Azure Functions triggered by Cosmos DB's Change Feed Processor. The article covers architectural patterns like CQRS and Materialized Views, global scaling with single-digit millisecond latency, and consumption-based cost modeling where you only pay for Request Units consumed. Practical for developers transitioning from monolithic, polling-based architectures to fully decoupled reactive systems.
