A developer attempted to migrate their long-running Jekyll blog to Hugo after discovering Jekyll's poor Ruby 4 compatibility and declining project activity. Content and layout mappings are straightforward (80%), but Jekyll plugins — custom generators, tags, and Liquid filters — have no direct Hugo equivalents. Despite Hugo's speed advantage and active community, the author ultimately decided not to complete the migration due to the plugin gap.
