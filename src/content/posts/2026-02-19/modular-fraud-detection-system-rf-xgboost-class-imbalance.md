A complete Credit Card Fraud Detection System built on the PaySim dataset, tackling the extreme 0.17% class imbalance challenge with balanced class weights in Random Forest and scale_pos_weight in XGBoost. The project features a modular architecture with separate data_loader, feature engineering, and model modules, achieving ROC-AUC ~0.999 with automated evaluation reports. End-to-end pytest integration tests keep the production ML pipeline stable during refactoring.
