Google CEO Sundar Pichai addressed world leaders at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, announcing a $15 billion infrastructure investment in India — including a full-stack AI hub in Visakhapatnam with gigawatt-scale compute. He cited AlphaFold as a landmark example of AI's transformative potential, compressing decades of protein-structure research into an open database now used by 3M+ researchers across 190 countries. Pichai called for bold yet responsible AI development, warning that the digital divide must not become an AI divide.
