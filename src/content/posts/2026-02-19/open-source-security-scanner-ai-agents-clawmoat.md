ClawMoat is a zero-dependency open-source security scanner purpose-built for AI agent sessions, with 8 modules and 37 tests covering prompt injection, credential leakage, data exfiltration, memory poisoning, tool abuse, and privilege escalation. The author scanned their own OpenClaw-based agent — one with shell access, browser control, and email — as industry voices from CrowdStrike, Cisco, Jamf, and OWASP began flagging agentic AI as a top emerging threat vector in early 2026.
