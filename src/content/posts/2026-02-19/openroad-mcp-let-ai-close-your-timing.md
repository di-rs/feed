OpenROAD MCP is a server that connects AI assistants like Claude Code directly to a live OpenROAD chip design process, enabling AI to analyze timing violations and automatically adjust SDC constraints to close timing. This eliminates the tedious manual loop of reading reports, tweaking constraints, re-running flows, and verifying results that can consume an hour of a VLSI engineer's time per iteration. The project demonstrates how AI-assisted automation can dramatically speed up hardware design cycles by giving LLMs direct access to live tooling state.
