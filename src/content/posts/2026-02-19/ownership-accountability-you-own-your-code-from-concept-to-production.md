True code ownership means taking responsibility for a feature from initial concept through production monitoring and eventual bug fixes — not just writing the code and moving on. The author introduces a "two-hour rule": if blocked for more than two hours, escalate immediately with documented attempts rather than staying silent and spinning. Setting up monitoring, alerts, and documentation before deployment is what separates engineers who own their work from those who just ship it.
