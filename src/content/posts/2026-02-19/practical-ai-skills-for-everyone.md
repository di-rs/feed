Google has launched the Google AI Professional Certificate to help workers move from AI basics to real fluency, addressing a critical skills gap where 70% of managers consider AI training essential but only 14% of workers have received it. Partners including Walmart, Deloitte, and Verizon will use the certificate to train employees, while Google is offering free access to small businesses through the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and America's SBDC network.
