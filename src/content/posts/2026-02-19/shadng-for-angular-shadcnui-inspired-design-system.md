ShadNG brings shadcn/ui's copy-paste ownership model to Angular as a 4-part toolkit: UI components, an icon package, an MCP server for AI-assisted development, and skill packs for Codex/Claude/Gemini. Teams can install packages normally or copy component source directly into their app for full control without fighting closed abstractions. The MCP server and skill packs give AI coding assistants structured context to generate design-system-consistent changes automatically.
