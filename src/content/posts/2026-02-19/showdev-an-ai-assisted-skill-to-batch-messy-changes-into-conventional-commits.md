`conventional-commit-batcher` is an open-source tool that helps developers turn messy, mixed working trees into a clean Conventional Commits history through a plan-first approach — grouping changes by intent (refactor, fix, docs) before staging them in batches. It also includes commit message validation and safety gates to catch risky changes before they land, preventing giant "misc" commits and making git history more reviewable and bisect-friendly.
