Japan's AI development faces a chronic shortage of culturally relevant training data, but NTT DATA and NVIDIA demonstrated a breakthrough using the Nemotron-Personas-Japan dataset of 6 million synthetic personas. By expanding just 240 seed samples into 138,000 synthetic training examples, they boosted model accuracy from 15.3% to 79.3% without exposing proprietary data. This fully open-source pipeline shows enterprises can build domain-specific AI at scale without expensive data collection.
