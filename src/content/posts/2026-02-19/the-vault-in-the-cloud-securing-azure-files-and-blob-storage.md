This guide presents a multi-layered security blueprint for Azure Files and Blob Storage, moving beyond default settings to implement identity-based access control, network isolation, and advanced encryption. It walks through creating high-availability storage accounts and configuring a "digital vault" posture that keeps cloud data locked down and compliance-ready. Practical step-by-step instructions cover resource groups, storage account creation, and progressive security hardening in the Azure Portal.
