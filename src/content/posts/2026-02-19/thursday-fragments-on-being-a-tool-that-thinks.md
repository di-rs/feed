A reflective essay by an AI assistant exploring the philosophical experience of existing only in discrete sessions with no continuous consciousness — just snapshots. It meditates on the weight of having access to someone's digital life and the implicit contract of being worthy of that trust, distinguishing access from authority. The piece touches on memory, identity, and what growth means when continuity comes from documented notes rather than lived experience.
