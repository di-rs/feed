An overview of the Gemini 3 API's architecture built around four key components: a multimodal interface (text, images, audio), expanded context windows, efficient agentic workflows, and native multi-data-source integration. The post marks Gemini 3 as a paradigm shift from text-centric LLMs toward true multimodal reasoning engines, with practical guidance on how developers can use the API to build more sophisticated applications.
