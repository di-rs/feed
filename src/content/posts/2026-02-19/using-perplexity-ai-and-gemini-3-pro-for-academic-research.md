A Master's researcher shares how combining Perplexity AI (as an aggregator for real-time search) with Gemini 3 Pro (for deep synthesis) dramatically cuts the hours spent on literature review and pre-reading. This "Research Stack" pairs Perplexity's web aggregation with Gemini's analytical depth to accelerate academic paper discovery, turning what used to take hours of manual research into a streamlined AI-assisted workflow. The author developed this approach while writing a thesis on 5G anomaly detection using TensorFlow Lite.
