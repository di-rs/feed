An analysis of 20 popular SaaS tools using TrustSignal's outside-in scanner reveals widespread security gaps visible to any buyer: 9/20 have missing DMARC records, 16/20 lack a public subprocessor list, and 100% had at least one critical trust gap findable in under 60 seconds. Only 3 out of 20 scored A or B overall, highlighting how enterprise buyers evaluate vendor security posture before purchasing. A wake-up call for SaaS companies to audit their public-facing compliance and security signals.
