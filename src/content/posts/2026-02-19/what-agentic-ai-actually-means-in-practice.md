Agentic AI is fundamentally about control flow — systems where the AI decides the next step rather than executing a single prompt-response cycle. A practical agentic system has four components: a goal, a decision loop (observe → act → update → repeat), tools/actions, and state management. The real engineering complexity isn't the intelligence but the feedback loops, error handling, and state consistency that make agents reliable rather than chaotic in production.
