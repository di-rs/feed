NDM-TCP, a nonlinear TCP congestion control algorithm, produces an unexpected stable sawtooth pattern that 30 years of calculus-based TCP theory struggles to fully explain — not because existing algorithms are bad, but because something unexpected happened that current models don't cover. The article argues this is a research-grade finding worth investigating, pointing to a gap between provable fluid-flow theory and the complexity of real-world networks. It's a call for newer mathematical frameworks that can model nonlinear congestion behavior more accurately.
