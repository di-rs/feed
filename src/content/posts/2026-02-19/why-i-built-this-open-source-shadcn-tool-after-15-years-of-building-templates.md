After 15 years of building web templates and UI kits, the author created Shadcn Space — an open-source library of UI blocks built on top of shadcn/ui for React and Next.js developers who want full control over their code. The project addresses the repetitive early layout work (sidebars, forms, tables, empty states) that consumes the start of every new product, without imposing opinionated design decisions or hiding implementation details. Shadcn Space recently crossed 300 GitHub stars and is actively expanding into a larger curated component library.
