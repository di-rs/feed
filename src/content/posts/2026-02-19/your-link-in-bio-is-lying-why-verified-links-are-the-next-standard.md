Link-in-bio platforms like Linktree and Bio.link display any URL you type without ever verifying you actually own those accounts — enabling impersonation, phishing clones, and stolen portfolio links. Using OAuth flows, every link can be cryptographically proven to belong to the profile owner, replacing pay-to-play badges with real ownership proof. The author proposes a model where each linked account triggers an OAuth consent flow, resulting in a verified badge that means "this person proved they own this" rather than "this person paid $8/month."
