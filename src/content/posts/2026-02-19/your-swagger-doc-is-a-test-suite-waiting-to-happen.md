Your Swagger/OpenAPI documentation can serve as a contract test suite, ensuring both API providers and consumers honor agreed-upon request/response formats, data types, and status codes. Contract testing verifies that your API delivers what it promises and catches breaking changes before they reach production. This approach leverages existing documentation as a source of truth, making API quality assurance both systematic and low-effort.
